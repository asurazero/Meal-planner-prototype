Dirty Soda Cookies


Ingredients
1 (15 ounce) box devil's food cake mix
6 fluid ounces Dr. PepperÂ® soda or cola
cooking spray
2 cups confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon coconut milk or coconut coffee creamer
1/8 teaspoon lime zest
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Stir cake mix and soda together in a bowl until a dough
forms (dough will be sticky). Coat hands lightly with
cooking spray and roll tablespoon-sized balls of dough.
Place dough balls on the prepared baking sheet and press
lightly to slightly flatten the tops. Bake in the preheated
oven until cookies are just baked around the edges and still
soft in the center, 8 to 9 minutes. Let cool for a few
minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack
set over parchment paper or set inside a baking sheet. Whisk
confectioner's sugar, coconut milk, lime zest, and salt
together in a bowl until smooth. Drizzle icing over cookies
and let stand until icing firms up slightly.
