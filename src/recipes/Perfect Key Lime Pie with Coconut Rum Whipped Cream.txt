Perfect Key Lime Pie with Coconut Rum Whipped Cream


Ingredients
11 graham crackers
1/4 cup sugar
5 tablespoons butter
1 (14 ounce) can plus 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
2/3 cup lime juice or Key lime juice (see Note)
1/2 teaspoon lime zest
3 large egg yolks
1/3 cup sour cream
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons coconut rum

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Break
graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor and add
sugar. Pulse until coarsely ground. Add melted butter and
pulse about 4 times until mixture resembles damp sand;
transfer to a pie plate and very lightly press into bottom
and up sides of the dish. Bake in the preheated oven just
until fragrant, 4 to 6 minutes. Let cool. Whisk together
sweetened condensed milk and lime juice until smooth. Whisk
in egg yolks until well combined. Stir in sour cream and
zest until smooth. Pour filling over graham cracker crust;
lightly spread in an even layer. Place pie dish on a rimmed
baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until just set
around the edges and slightly jiggly in the center, 14 to 16
minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool to room temperature,
about 40 minutes. Chill pie in the refrigerator for at least
8 hours. Place cream, powdered sugar, and rum in a mixing
bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until cream holds medium
peaks. Serve pie with whipped cream.
