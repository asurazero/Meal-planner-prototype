Smoked Pork Chops with Sauerkraut


Ingredients
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
4 cooked pork chops
1/3 cup onion
1 (16 ounce) jar sauerkraut
1 apple
1/2 cup beef broth
1 teaspoon bacon grease
1 clove garlic, minced
5 juniper berries
1 bay leaf

Cooking Instructions

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Quickly sear meat for 2 minutes on each side, and remove
from pan. Reduce heat to medium, add onions, and saute for 3
minutes. Stir in sauerkraut, apple, beef broth, bacon
grease, garlic, juniper berries, and bay leaf. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Remove bay leaf, add chops back to skillet, and nestle in
the kraut. Simmer just until chops are warmed up, 3 to 5
minutes. Cooking further will dry them out.
