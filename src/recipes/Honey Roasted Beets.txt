Honey Roasted Beets


Ingredients
3 large beets
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons honey

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut stems and leaves from
beets and wash well. With skin on, cut beets into chunks.
Toss beets in olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Spread beets
in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast in the
preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and
drizzle with honey. Using a wooden spoon, stir beets to coat
completely with honey, then spread them back out on the pan.
Continue roasting until tender, about 15 minutes. Allow to
cool.
