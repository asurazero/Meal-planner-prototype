Gingerbread Latte Cookies


Ingredients
3/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1 extra large egg, at room temperature
1/4 cup molasses
2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon espresso
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda

Cooking Instructions

Beat butter, brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar together
in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add in egg,
molasses, 2 tablespoons espresso powder, vanilla, ginger,
cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice and beat until
thoroughly combined, 2 to 3 minutes. Add in 1 cup flour and
baking soda, and mix until just combined. Add in remaining 1
cup flour and mix until just combined. Cover dough and
refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 48 hours. Preheat
the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 2 baking
sheets with parchment paper. Whisk remaining 1/4 cup white
sugar and 1/2 teaspoon instant powder together in a shallow
bowl until combined. Remove cookie dough from the
refrigerator. Scoop out 1 1/2 tablespoons dough, and roll
into a ball. Roll dough ball in espresso sugar until
thoroughly coated. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Repeat with remaining dough, spacing dough balls about 2
inches apart. Bake cookies, 1 baking sheet at a time, in the
preheated oven, until cookies are crackled on top and edges
of the cookies look set, 12 to 15 minutes. Allow cookies to
cool for at least 5 minutes on the pan before removing to a
wire rack to cool completely.
