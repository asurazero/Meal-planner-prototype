Homemade Fish Sticks


Ingredients
1 pound cod
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 cup panko bread crumbs
2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning
1 large egg
1 tablespoon water
1/3 cup flour
cooking spray
1 lemon, cut into wedges
1/3 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons pickle relish (sweet or dill)
1 tablespoon red onion
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh dill
1 teaspoons capers (optional)
1/2 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
(190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or
use a silicone baking mat. Blot fish dry with paper towels.
Season fish with salt and pepper. Cut filets crosswise in
1-inch strips. Combine panko and Old Bay seasoning in a
shallow dish. Beat together egg and water in a second
shallow dish. Place flour in a third shallow dish. Dip fish
pieces in flour to coat, shaking off excess, then in egg
mixture, then in panko. Place breaded fish sticks on the
prepared baking sheet. Coat fish sticks generously with
cooking spray. Bake freshly breaded or frozen fish sticks
until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes, turning once halfway
through baking time. For Tartar Sauce, in a small bowl whisk
together mayonnaise, pickle relish, onion, dill weed, capers
(if using), and lemon juice. Chill at least 2 hours before
serving and up to 1 week. Serve fish sticks with Tartar
Sauce and lemon wedges.
