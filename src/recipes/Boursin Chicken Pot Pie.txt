Boursin Chicken Pot Pie


Ingredients
2 tablespoons butter
1 leek, white and pale green parts, thinly sliced
8 ounces button mushrooms, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons flour
1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 (5.3-ounce) semi-soft cheese with garlic and fine herbs (siuch as Boursin®)
1/4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon mustard
1 cup frozen mixed vegetables
3 cups shredded cooked chicken
1/2 (14.1-ounce) package rolled refrigerated unbaked pie crust

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C). Melt butter in a large skillet over medium
heat. Add leek and mushrooms. Cook and stir until tender and
any liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Whisk together
broth, Boursin®, sour cream, and mustard in a bowl. Add to
the skillet. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly, about
2 minutes. Add frozen mixed vegetables and cook 3 minutes
more. Stir in chicken and return to a simmer, about 1
minute. Transfer hot filling to a 9-inch pie plate or
10-inch quiche dish. Cut 3 slits in the center of the pie
crust. Gently fold pie crust in quarters. Unfold pie crust
atop the hot filling. Press edges of pastry to the inside
edge of the pie plate, flute as desired. Bake in the
preheated oven until golden brown and bubbly, about 20
minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
