Old-Fashioned Potato Salad


Ingredients
5 medium potatoes
3 large eggs
1 cup chopped celery
½ cup chopped onion
½ cup sweet pickle relish
¼ cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
¼ teaspoon garlic salt
¼ teaspoon celery salt
ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Bring a large pot of salted water to
a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm,
about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, peel, and chop potatoes.
While potatoes cook, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with
cold water. Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat,
and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove
from hot water, cool, peel, and chop eggs. Combine the
potatoes, eggs, celery, onion, relish, mayonnaise, mustard,
garlic salt, celery salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix
together well and refrigerate until chilled. Enjoy!
