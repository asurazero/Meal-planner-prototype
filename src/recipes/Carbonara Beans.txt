Carbonara Beans


Ingredients
4 slices bacon,
2 cloves garlic
1/4 cup white wine
1/2 cup whipping cream
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more for garnish
2 (14.5 ounce) cans cannellini beans
fresh parsley, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Cook bacon in a large skillet over
medium heat until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Add
garlic and cook 30 seconds more. Add wine and simmer until
reduced by half, about 3 minutes.. Add cream and bring just
to a simmer. Stir in the 1/2 cup cheese, salt, and cracked
black pepper; continue cooking until lightly thickened,
stirring often, about 3 minutes. Add beans and heat through,
about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with additional cracked black
pepper, remaining 2 tablespoons cheese, and parsley.
