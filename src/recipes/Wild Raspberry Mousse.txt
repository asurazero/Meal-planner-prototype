Wild Raspberry Mousse


Ingredients
3 cups raspberries
1/2 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1 pinch salt
1 1/4 teaspoons gelatin
3 tablespoons water
1/2 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Place raspberries, maple syrup, lemon juice, lemon zest, and
salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring
often, until berries begin to burst and release their
juices; about 10 minutes. Place a fine mesh sieve over a
medium bowl. Pour berry mixture into the sieve. Using the
back of a wooden spoon or spatula, press firmly on the
mixture to release as much of the juice as possible. Discard
seeds. Place gelatin and cold water into a small bowl and
allow gelatin to bloom for 5 minutes. Add gelatin to the
saucepan the berries were in, and heat over low heat,
stirring often, until gelatin is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes.
Pour strained berry juice back into the pan with gelatin,
and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until just
beginning to simmer. Remove from heat, and stir in yogurt
until completely smooth and combined. Let mixture cool to
room temperature. Beat cream and vanilla together In a large
bowl until cream holds stiff peaks. Stir 1/4 of whipped
cream into cooled berry mixture, then fold berry mixture
into remaining whipped cream until smooth and combined. Pour
mousse into serving containers. Cover lightly with plastic
wrap; refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours to
overnight.
