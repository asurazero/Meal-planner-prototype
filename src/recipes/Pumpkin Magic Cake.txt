Pumpkin Magic Cake


Ingredients
Baking spray
1 package spice cake mix
1 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
5 large eggs, divided
2 packages cream cheese
2/3 cup canned pumpkin
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
3.4 ounce instant pudding
1 cup whole milk
1 container frozen whipped topping

Cooking Instructions

Gather ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Spray 10-inch springform pan with baking
spray. Combine cake mix, water, oil, and 3 eggs in a large
bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speet until
well combined. Pour batter into the prepared springform pan.
Beat cream cheese in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle on
medium speed until just smooth, 15 to 20 seconds, do not
overmix. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add sugar and
beat on medium speed until just combined, about 20 seconds,
stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. Whisk in
canned pumpkin, remaining 2 eggs, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice
until combined. It is okay if the batter is speckled with
very small lumps of cream cheese. Slowly spoon pumpkin
mixture over cake mixture and spread it into an even layer,
leaving about a 1/2-inch border around the edges of the pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until risen, and a wooden pick
inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour,
loosely tenting with foil after 50 minutes if needed to
avoid over-browning. Let cool completely in the pan on a
wire rack, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, whisk together instant
pudding and milk until thickened and smooth. Gently fold in
whipped topping until no streaks remain. Spoon topping over
cooled cake and spread into an even layer. Slice and enjoy!
