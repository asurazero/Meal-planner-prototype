Overnight Breakfast Bake with Ham Cheese and Croissants


Ingredients
butter-flavored cooking spray
2 large croissants
½ cup shredded Gruyere cheese
1 cup diced cooked ham
6 large eggs
¾ cup milk
½ cup sour cream
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons chopped green onions (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Spray an 8x8-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Cut
croissants into 1 inch cubes (about 4 cups, loosely packed)
and spread out on the bottom of the prepared pan. Sprinkle
evenly with cheese and ham. Combine eggs, milk, sour cream,
Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Beat the mixture
until well blended using a wire whisk or an egg beater. Pour
egg mixture evenly over the top of the croissants, cheese,
and ham. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and place in the
refrigerator for 8 hours. When ready to bake, set the dish
out of the refrigerator on the counter, Preheat the oven to
350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Uncover casserole, place in
the center of the preheated oven, and bake until the
casserole is set, and a knife inserted into the middle of
the casserole comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cut into
serving pieces and garnish with chopped green onions.
