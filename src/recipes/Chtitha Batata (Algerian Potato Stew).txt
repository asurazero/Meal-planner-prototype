1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon black pepper
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 ½ pounds new potatoes, halved
1 tablespoon tomato paste

large saucepan over medium heat and stir-fry dersa until
fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Add potato halves and stir to
