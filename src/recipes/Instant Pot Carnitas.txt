Instant Pot Carnitas


Ingredients
1 (6 pound) pork butt roast
1 ½ tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon chile powder
½ teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more to taste
1 cup orange juice
1 onion, coarsely chopped
4 cloves garlic, diced, or more to taste

Cooking Instructions

Trim excess fat from pork butt; cut pork into 2-inch cubes
and transfer to a large bowl. Combine salt, oregano, cumin,
black pepper, chile powder, and paprika in a small bowl. Rub
pork cubes with spice mixture. Coat seasoned pork cubes
lightly in olive oil; transfer to a pressure cooker. Cover
pork cubes with orange juice, onion, and garlic. Cover pork
cubes with orange juice, onion, and garlic. Place lid on the
pressure cooker and lock; bring to full pressure over medium
heat until pork is no longer pink in the center, about 60
minutes. Let pressure come down naturally, about 15 minutes.
Remove pork from the pressure cooker and shred meat.
