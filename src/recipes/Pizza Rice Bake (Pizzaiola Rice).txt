Pizza Rice Bake (Pizzaiola Rice)


Ingredients
cooking spray
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 1/2 cups white rice
2 1/4 cups vegetable
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups marinara sauce
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
15 pepperoni slices
1 cup shredded low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese
torn fresh basil leaves

Cooking Instructions

Gather all Ingredients. Spray an 8-inch broiler-safe baking
dish with cooking spray, and set aside. Melt butter in a
large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and crushed red
pepper and cook, stirring often, until garlic is lightly
browned and aromatic, about 1 minute. Add rice, and cook,
stirring occasionally until lightly toasted, about 3
minutes. Stir in stock, salt, pepper, and 1 1/2 cups
marinara sauce. Bring to a boil over medium heat, reduce
heat to medium-low, and simmer, covered, stirring every few
minutes, until rice is almost fully cooked through, 18 to 20
minutes Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C);
Remove from heat, stir in Parmesan cheese and remaining 1/2
cup marinara, until evenly combined. Transfer rice mixture
to the prepared baking dish, spreading it into an even
layer. Top evenly with pepperoni and mozzarella. Bake in the
preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
With baking dish still in the oven, increase oven
temperature to broil; broil until cheese is just golden
brown, 2 to 5 more minutes. Remove from the oven and garnish
with basil.
