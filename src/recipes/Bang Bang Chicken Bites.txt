Bang Bang Chicken Bites


Ingredients
24 ounces chicken nuggets
1/2 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons sweet chili sauce
1 tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce,
1/4 cup green onions

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 300 degrees F (193 degrees C). Add
nuggets in a single layer to the air fryer basket, and fry
until hot and crisp, about 10 minutes, shaking the basket
halfway through cooking time. You may need to work in
batches. (Alternately, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Place nuggets in a single layer on a baking sheet, and bake
in the preheated oven until golden, about 12 minutes.)
Meanwhile, stir mayonnaise, chili sauce, and hot sauce
together in a large bowl until well blended. Toss hot
chicken nuggets in sauce until well coated. Top with green
onions before serving.
