Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwich


Ingredients
2 slices bacon
4 teaspoons butter, divided
3 large eggs
1 pinch black pepper
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
4 slices bread

Cooking Instructions

Place bacon in a nonstick skillet and cook over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 7
minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Remove bacon to
a drip line tray. Drain off bacon grease for another use.
Wash out the skillet. Whisk eggs with salt and pepper in a
small bowl until frothy. Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the
nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs; let
cook for 30 seconds. Lift the edges of the omelet so that
the uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges and comes into
contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to
move the uncooked egg. Repeat until the top is set, about 3
minutes; reduce heat to low. Meanwhile, chop bacon roughly;
sprinkle over omelet. Sprinkle with cheese; allow cheese to
melt, 1 to 2 minutes. Meanwhile, butter 2 slices of bread
with 1/2 teaspoon butter each. Lay bread, buttered side up,
side-by-side over omelet, leaving about 1 inch between
slices. The melted cheese will help the bread adhere. Run a
spatula around the entire omelet to loosen from the skillet.
Carefully turn the omelet over so buttered side of bread is
in contact with the skillet. Cook until bread is toasted and
golden, about 2 minutes. Using the spatula, fold in edges of
omelet to align with sides of the bread. Cut omelet along
center with the spatula to form 2 sandwiches. Butter 2
remaining bread slices with remaining butter; place butter
side up on each sandwich. Turn sandwiches; cook until
golden, about 2 minutes more. Serve and enjoy immediately!
