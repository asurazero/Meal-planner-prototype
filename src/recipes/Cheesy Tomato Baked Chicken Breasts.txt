Cheesy Tomato Baked Chicken Breasts


Ingredients
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 lemon, juiced
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 ½ cups halved cherry tomatoes
1 bunch green onions, cut into ½-inch slices
½ cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons coarse-grained mustard
1 ½ sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped
½ bunch fresh thyme, chopped
2 cups shredded Gruyère cheese

Cooking Instructions

Pour 3 tablespoons olive oil into a shallow platter and lay
chicken breasts on top. Rub with lemon juice, salt, and
pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a nonstick skillet
over medium-high heat and cook chicken breasts until
browned, about 4 minutes per side. Preheat oven to 350
degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish. Place
tomatoes and green onions in the baking dish and pour
chicken broth on top. Combine mustard, rosemary, and thyme
in a small bowl and brush onto chicken breasts. Place
chicken breasts on top of the vegetables in the baking dish.
Cover with Gruyère cheese. Bake in the preheated oven on the
middle rack until chicken is no longer pink in the center
and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
