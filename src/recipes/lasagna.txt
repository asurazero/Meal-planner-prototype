Cooking Instructions

Cook and stir sausage in a large pot until browned, about 5
minutes. Stir in onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Pour in
chicken broth, tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes; bring soup
to a boil. Stir pasta into the soup. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in
spinach, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Remove from
heat; stir in basil and let stand until pasta is tender,
about 2 minutes more.
