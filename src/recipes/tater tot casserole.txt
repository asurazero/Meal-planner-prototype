Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
9x13-inch baking dish. Cook and stir ground beef, onion,
garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a skillet over
medium heat until beef is browned and crumbly, 7 to 10
minutes. Spread beef into the bottom of the prepared baking
dish. Stir cream of mushroom soup, potato nuggets, and
Cheddar cheese together in a large bowl until potato nuggets
are evenly coated in soup and cheese. Spread potato nugget
mixture over beef mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until
browned, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle paprika and parsley
flakes over the top.
