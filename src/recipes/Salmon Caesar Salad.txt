Salmon Caesar Salad


Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) salmon filet
2 teaspoons oil
2 teaspoons honey
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 large egg
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
2 cloves garlic
3 anchovies
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
2 slices bread
1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 head Romaine lettuce
shaved Parmesan cheese for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Set a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Heat 2
teaspoons oil until it shimmers. Add salmon, skin side down.
Brush with honey; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and
cook for 4 minutes. Carefully flip salmon and reduce the
heat to medium. Continue cooking until fish flakes easily
with a fork, about 5 minutes more. Remove salmon to a plate
or container; cover and refrigerate until very cold, at
least 2 hours. For dressing, crack an egg into a food
processor. Add lemon juice, Worcestershire, Dijon, garlic,
anchovies, grated Parmesan and black pepper; pulse to
combine. With food processor running, drizzle in oil until
mixture emulsifies. Refrigerate dressing until needed. For
croutons, melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high
heat. Add bread cubes; sprinkle with Italian seasoning and
granulated garlic. Toast until croutons are browned, about 5
minutes. Remove from heat; set aside. For salad, add lettuce
to a large bowl. Flake salmon with a fork into bite-sized
pieces and add to the bowl. Drizzle with Caesar dressing;
top with croutons and shaved Parmesan.
