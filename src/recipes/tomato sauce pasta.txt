Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir
beef in the hot skillet until browned completely, 5 to 7
minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir tomato sauce, basil,
oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, sugar, salt, and
pepper into beef. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and
cook sauce at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick
and rich, about 1 hour.
