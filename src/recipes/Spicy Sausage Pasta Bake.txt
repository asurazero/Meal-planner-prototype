Spicy Sausage Pasta Bake


Ingredients
1 pound rigatoni pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons butter
1 small onion
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1/2 pound 93% lean ground beef
1/2 pound hot Italian sausage
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons Calabrian chili paste, or to taste
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles
22 ounces marinara sauce
1 ounce creme fraiche
1 cup fat-free half-and-half
1 cup heavy cream
8 ounces mozzarella, broken into pieces
1 tablespoon parsley, or as needed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fill a
large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling
boil. Stir in rigatoni and return to a boil. Cook pasta
uncovered for 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain.
Meanwhile, add olive oil and butter to a heavy cast iron or
other ovenproof skillet. When butter is melted, add onion to
the skillet, and sauté until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.
Add mushrooms, and sauté until softened, about 3 minutes.
Add beef and sausage. Cook, breaking up meat with a spatula,
until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic,
Calabrian chile paste, and RoTel. Sauté for about 1 minute.
Stir in marinara sauce. Stir in crème fraîche, half-and-
half, and whipping cream. Fold in rigatoni until combined;
fold in half of mozzarella. Scatter remaining mozzarella on
top of skillet. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly,
about 30 minutes. Scatter parsley over top. Serve
immediately.
