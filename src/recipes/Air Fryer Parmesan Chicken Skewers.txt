Air Fryer Parmesan Chicken Skewers


Ingredients
1 1/4 pounds chicken breast tenders
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)
according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Place chicken
tenders in a large bowl. Add olive oil, garlic powder,
paprika, parsley flakes, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat. Add
grated Parmesan cheese. Toss to coat until evenly combined.
Thread a tender on to each skewer and place each skewer in
the basket of the air fryer in an even layer. They can
touch, but should not overlap. Cook for 7 minutes. Flip
skewers and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the
center and juices run clear, about 3 minutes more. An
instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of chicken
should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
