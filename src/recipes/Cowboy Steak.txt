Cowboy Steak


Ingredients
1/4 cup salted butter
2 teaspoons fresh parsley
1 teaspoon stone ground Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 clove garlic
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 (2 1/2-inch-thick) beef cowboy steak (bone-in ribeye)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon black pepper

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. For compound butter, combine butter,
parsley, mustard, rosemary, smoked paprika, garlic, and
cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Spoon onto a sheet of waxed
paper. Roll into a log. Wrap in the waxed paper. Chill in
the refrigerator until firm, 30 minutes or up to 1 week. For
steak, let steak stand at room temperature for 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a
wire rack in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Heat oil in a
12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high until it starts
to smoke. Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Sear
steak in the skillet until well-browned, 5 minutes per side,
then 2 minutes on the fat cap side. Place steak on the rack
in the prepared baking sheet. Roast 45 minutes or until an
instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers
135 degrees F (57 degrees C) for medium rare, or 150 degrees
F (65 degrees C) for medium. Place steak on a cutting board.
Tent loosely with foil. Let rest 10 minutes. Temperature
will continue to rise as steak rests. Slice between meat and
bone to separate. Thinly slice steak across the grain. Top
sliced steak with Cowboy Compound Butter.
