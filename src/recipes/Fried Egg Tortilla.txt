Fried Egg Tortilla


Ingredients
2 teaspoons butter
1 large egg
1/4 teaspoon taco seasoning, or to taste
1 1/2 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (6 to 7-inch) flour tortilla

Cooking Instructions

In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat,
and swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly. Carefully break
egg into buttered skillet and cook until egg white is opaque
and egg is firm enough to turn, about 1 minute. Turn egg
over, being careful not to break yolk; sprinkle with taco
seasoning and about half of cheese. Gently place tortilla
over egg and cheese, and cook about 1 minute. Using a
silicone egg turner, flip the egg and tortilla, as one.
Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of the egg, and continue
cooking until the egg is done to your liking and the
tortilla is warm and toasty, about 2 minutes. Slide tortilla
and egg to a serving plate and serve warm.
