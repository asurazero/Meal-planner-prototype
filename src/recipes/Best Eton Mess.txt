Best Eton Mess


Ingredients
2 cups heavy cream
2 tablespoons white sugar, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups fresh raspberries, divided
2 cups sliced fresh strawberries, divided
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon rose water (optional)
8 small plain meringue cookies

Cooking Instructions

Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric
mixer until frothy. Add 1 tablespoon sugar and vanilla
extract gradually, continuing to beat until stiff peaks
form. Keep cream chilled in the refrigerator. Combine 1/2 of
the raspberries, 1/2 of the strawberries, remaining 1
tablespoon sugar, and balsamic vinegar in a bowl; mash
berries with a fork and chill in the refrigerator until
ready to serve. To serve, combine mashed fruit and cream in
a bowl. Add the remaining strawberries, raspberries, and
rose water; fold everything together. Place your meringues
in a bowl and break them up into a mix of small and big
chunks for a variation in texture. Layer meringues and cream
mixture into dessert bowls or glasses and serve immediately.
