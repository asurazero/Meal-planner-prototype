Cheesecake-Stuffed Snickerdoodle Cookie


Ingredients
4 ounces cream cheese
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper. For filling, mix softened
cream cheese and sugar together until smooth. Scoop filling
into small balls and place onto the prepared baking sheet.
Freeze for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine butter,
brown sugar, and white sugar in a bowl and beat with an
electric mixer until creamy. Add egg and vanilla extract;
beat until smooth and fluffy Reduce mixer speed to low and
beat in flour, cinnamon, and baking soda just until flour
disappears. In a separate shallow bowl stir 1/4 cup sugar
and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together for the cinnamon sugar.
Scoop cookie dough by 2 tablespoonfuls and flatten into a
circle with your hands. Place a ball of cream cheese filling
in the center of the cookie dough. Press cookie dough up and
around filling, sealing filling inside. Roll each cookie
dough ball into the cinnamon sugar mixture and place on a
baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in the
preheated oven until cookies are just turning golden on the
bottom and the edges, 12 to 14 minutes.
