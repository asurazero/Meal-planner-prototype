Roasted Cauliflower Steaks With Chimichurri


Ingredients
1/2 cup parsley
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
salt to taste
2 heads cauliflower
1/4 cup olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine parsley, olive
oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, red pepper flakes, oregano,
and salt in a bowl. Set aside. Remove the tough bottom
leaves from each cauliflower, taking care not to remove the
stem. Place the cauliflower heads onto a cutting board with
the stem side facing upwards; cut vertically on both sides
of the stem to remove the loose florets. Cut each
cauliflower vertically through the stem into 2 even
"steaks", 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick; remove any remaining
small leaves from each steak. Reserve remaining cauliflower
for another use. Place cauliflower steaks on the baking
sheet. Brush both sides with olive oil and sprinkle with
garlic salt. Roast in the preheated oven until the edges are
golden brown and the cauliflower is tender, 25 to 30
minutes, flipping halfway through. Place cauliflower on a
serving platter and spoon chimichurri sauce over top.
