Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Prepare the Marinated Chicken: Place
lemon quarters inside chicken cavity; put chicken in a large
resealable plastic bag. Stir together lemon juice, lemon
zest, soy sauce, hot sauce, ketchup, onion powder, thyme,
salt, and liquid smoke in a medium bowl until combined. Pour
lemon juice mixture over chicken in the bag. Let marinate at
room temperature for at least 1 hour or refrigerate for up
to 16 hours. Remove from refrigerator, and bring to room
temperature before roasting, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to
400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove chicken from marinade,
and discard marinade. Pat chicken dry, and evenly brush
Dijon mustard on chicken. Prepare the Dry Rub: Stir together
onion powder, salt, smoked paprika, black pepper, thyme,
garlic powder, cloves, and nutmeg in a small bowl. Sprinkle
dry rub evenly over chicken, firmly pressing to adhere. Tuck
wing tips behind shoulders. Tie legs together with kitchen
twine. Place chicken, breast side up, on a wire rack set
inside a large-rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the preheated
oven at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 20 minutes,
uncovered, then loosely cover with foil. Continue baking
until chicken is cooked through and a thermometer inserted
into thickest part of chicken breast 160 degrees F (71
degrees C), 1 hour 20 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, rotating
chicken front to back halfway through. Remove from oven and
place chicken on a cutting board; let chicken rest for 15
minutes. Carve chicken and garnish with lemon slices and
fresh thyme leaves.
