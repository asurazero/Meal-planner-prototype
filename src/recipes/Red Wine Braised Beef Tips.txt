Red Wine Braised Beef Tips


Ingredients
3 pounds beef tips (see Note:)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large onion
12 ounces mushrooms
4 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 cup red wine
1 cup beef broth
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup all-purpose flour

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Season
beef tips with salt and black pepper. Heat a Dutch oven over
medium-high heat, then add oil. Add seasoned beef tips and
brown on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove beef tips to a
plate and keep warm. Reduce heat to medium; add onions and
mushrooms. Cook, stirring continuously, until vegetables are
softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme. Pour in
wine, and stir, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom
of the pan. Bring to a boil and add beef broth and
Worcestershire sauce. Adjust seasoning, if necessary, and
add meat and any accumulated juices to the pot. Bake,
covered, in the preheated oven until meat is fork tender, 1
1/2 to 2 hours. Using a slotted spoon, remove meat and
mushrooms from braising liquid. Place flour in a small bowl
and add about 1/2 cup of water. Whisk briskly until there
are no lumps. Whisk about 1/2 cup of braising liquid into
the flour mixture. Whisk flour mixture into the braising
liquid in the pan. Place pot over medium heat, stirring
briskly, until mixture comes to a boil. Continue to whisk
until bubbles collapse and look like bullseyes, about 3
minutes. Add beef and mushrooms back to the liquid and
serve.
