Lemon Garlic Butter Chicken Spiedini


Ingredients
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup white wine, such as Pinot Grigio
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
4 cloves garlic
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon oregano
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon pepper
2 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs
2/3 cup Italian breadcrumbs
2/3 cup panko
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
skewers
cooking spray
4 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons fresh parsley

Cooking Instructions

Whisk together olive oil, wine, 2 tablespoons lemon juice,
lemon zest, 1/2 of the garlic, crushed red pepper, oregano,
1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Add
chicken and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes
to 1 hour. Stir together remaining salt and pepper with
bread crumbs, panko, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder in a
shallow dish. Remove chicken from marinade and toss to coat
in breadcrumb mixture, pressing to adhere as necessary.
Thread chicken onto skewers and coat with olive oil cooking
spray. Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (198 degrees
C). Air fry until chicken is no longer pink at the center
and juices run clear, and is until lightly golden brown and
crisp, about 12 minutes. An instant read thermometer,
inserted near the center, should read 165 degrees F (74
degrees C). Meanwhile, melt butter with remaining garlic in
a microwave-safe dish on High in the microwave, about 10
seconds. Stir in remaining lemon juice and parsley. Drizzle
butter mixture over chicken just before serving.
