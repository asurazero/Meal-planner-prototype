4-Ingredient Banana Bread


Ingredients
5 small ripe spotted bananas, divided (about 4 1/2 ounces each)
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1/2 cup plus 1 dark brown sugar, divided
2 cups self rising flour

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Line a 9- x 5-inch loaf pan with parchment
paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides; set aside.
Mash 4 of the bananas in a large bowl using a fork until
mostly smooth to equal 1 1/2 cups. Add eggs and 1/2 cup
brown sugar; stir until combined. Add flour to the banana
mixture; stir until just combined and no dry streaks remain,
scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Pour batter
into the prepared loaf pan and spread into an even layer.
Slice remaining banana in half lengthwise; lay banana halves
over the top, cut side up. Evenly sprinkle remaining 1
tablespoon brown sugar over the top. Bake in the preheated
oven until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out
with a few moist crumbs, 50 to 55 minutes. Let cool in pan
on a wire rack for 15 minutes; using parchment paper
overhang. Remove loaf from pan and slice; serve warm. Enjoy!
