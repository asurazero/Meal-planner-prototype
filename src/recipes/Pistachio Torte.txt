Pistachio Torte


Ingredients
cooking spray
1/2 cup salted butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chopped pecans or pistachios
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) carton frozen whipped topping
2 1/2 cups milk
2 (3.4-ounce) packages pistachio instant pudding mix
1/2 cup chopped pistachios

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking
spray. Beat butter with an electric mixer in a bowl until
fluffy. Beat in flour, pecans, and 1/4 cup powdered sugar.
Spread in an even layer in the prepared dish. Bake in the
preheated oven until light golden brown, about 18 minutes.
Cool completely on a wire rack, about 45 minutes. Beat cream
cheese with an electric mixer in a bowl until fluffy. Beat
in remaining 1 cup powdered sugar and vanilla until
combined. Fold in half of the whipped topping. Spread cream
cheese filling evenly over the crust. Chill in the
refrigerator for 15 minutes. Whisk together milk and pudding
mix in a bowl for 2 minutes. Pour pistachio pudding evenly
over the cream cheese filling. Chill in the refrigerator
until set, about 15 minutes. Spread remaining whipped
topping over the pudding layer. Top with pistachios, or top
with pistachios just before serving. Cover and chill in the
refrigerator 3 hours or up to 4 days.
