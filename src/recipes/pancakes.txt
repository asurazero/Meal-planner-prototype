Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Combine buttermilk, flour, oats,
egg, oil, sugar, vanilla, baking powder, baking soda, and
salt in a blender; pur√©e until smooth. Heat a lightly oiled
griddle or large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour 1/4
cupfuls batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles form
on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned
on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Serve immediately.
