Steak and Potato Foil Packets


Ingredients
1 pound potatoes, halved
1 1/2 pounds sirloin steak, cut into bite-sized strips
1 yellow onion, sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 carrot, thinly sliced
4 tablespoons butter, or as needed
1 teaspoon steak seasoning, or as needed
5 cloves garlic, chopped, or more to taste

Cooking Instructions

Prepare an outdoor grill, preferably a charcoal grill, for
medium-high heat. Place potatoes in a microwave-safe dish
and cook on high until they are tender with a bite, about 3
minutes. Divide steak, potatoes, onions, red and green bell
pepper, and carrots evenly onto 4 to 6 squares of aluminum
foil. Add 1 tablespoon butter and a little fresh garlic to
each pack; fold foil over the top to close each packet
tightly. Place foil packs on the hot side of the grill. Cook
for 5 minutes. Carefully open one foil pack to check for
steak doneness. If steak is not cooked to your taste after 5
minutes, continue to cook, checking for doneness every few
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center will read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium
rare.
