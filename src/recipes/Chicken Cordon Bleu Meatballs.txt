Chicken Cordon Bleu Meatballs


Ingredients
1/4 cup shallot
1/4 cup half-and-half cream
1 tablespoon fresh parsley
1 large egg
2/3 cup Italian breadcrumbs
1/2 cup deli ham (about 3 ounces)
1 pound ground chicken
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs
2 ounces Swiss cheese, cut into 12 cubes
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 tablespoons flour
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup half-and-half cream or
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Combine shallot, half and half, parsley, egg, and 1/3 cup
Italian breadcrumbs in a mixing bowl and stir together. Add
ham and chicken; season with salt, pepper, garlic powder,
and paprika. Mix all ingredients together just until
uniform. Add remaining Italian bread crumbs and panko to a
shallow dish and stir to combine. Roll meat mixture into 12
balls and stuff a Swiss cheese cube into the center. Roll
each ball in breadcrumbs until evenly coated; place on a
plate or baking sheet. Freeze meatballs for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)
and set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Heat oil
in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add meatballs and
cook until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer
meatballs to the prepared wire rack. Bake meatballs in the
preheated oven until an instant read thermometer, inserted
near the center, reads 165 degrees F (175 degrees C), about
10 minutes. Meanwhile, make sauce. Wipe skillet clean and
melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook 1
minute. Whisk in broth and half-and-half. Stir in mustard,
salt, and pepper and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat and
simmer until sauce is rich and creamy, about 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Serve meatballs
with Dijon cream sauce.
