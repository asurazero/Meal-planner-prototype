Grilled Tri-Tip


Ingredients
4 pounds tri-tip roast
4 cloves garlic, peeled and very thinly sliced
⅓ cup salt
⅓ cup black pepper
⅓ cup garlic salt or to taste

Cooking Instructions

Using a sharp knife, cut small slits in the top of the
roast; insert garlic slices into the slits. Mix salt,
pepper, and garlic salt together in a small bowl; rub all
over the tri-tip and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up
to 1 day. Remove tri-tip from the refrigerator about 20
minutes before grilling. Preheat an outdoor grill for high
heat and lightly oil the grate. Place the meat directly
above the flame to sear the meat and lock in the juices,
about 5 to 10 minutes per side. Turn the grill down to
medium heat and continue to cook, turning occasionally, for
another 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63
degrees C) for medium-rare. Let stand, covered loosely with
aluminum foil, for 5 minutes before slicing.
