Mac and Cheese Cowboy Cups


Ingredients
2 boxes macaroni and cheese
2/3 cups whole milk
5 tablespoons butter
1 pound ground beef
1 packet taco seasoning
1/2 cup onion
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles,
2 cups pepper Jack cheese
sour cream, jalapeno slices, and chopped cilantro for topping

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2
standard 12-cup muffin tins. Bring a large pot of salted
water to a boil. Stir in macaroni and boil 5 minutes; drain
and return to the pot. Stir in cheese packet, milk, and
butter until well combined and creamy. Set aside and keep
warm. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
Add beef and cook, stirring often and breaking up with a
spatula, until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Add
taco seasoning and onion and cook for 2 minutes, stirring
constantly. Add water and cook, scraping up any browned bits
from the bottom of the pan. Stir in tomatoes and remove from
heat. Stir beef mixture into prepared macaroni and cheese.
Season to taste with additional taco seasoning. Stir in
cheese. Scoop mixture into prepared muffin pans. Use a small
spoon to create a small well in the center for toppings
later. Alternatively, mixture can be placed in a lightly
greased casserole dish and baked as a side dish. Bake in the
preheated oven until browned around the edges and bubbly, 20
to 25 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes. Serve with desired
toppings.
