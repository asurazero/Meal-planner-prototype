Grandma's Best Zucchini Bread


Ingredients
3 cups all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground ginger
1 pinch ground black pepper
2 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups shredded zucchini
½ cup dates, pitted and chopped

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease
and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans. Whisk flour, baking
powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and pepper
together in a bowl until evenly combined; set aside. Beat
sugar, oil, eggs and vanilla in a mixing bowl until smooth.
Fold in flour mixture, zucchini, and dates until no dry
spots remain. Divide the batter between the prepared loaf
pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted
into the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Cool in
the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely
on a wire rack.
