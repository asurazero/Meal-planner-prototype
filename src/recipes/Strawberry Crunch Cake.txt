Strawberry Crunch Cake


Ingredients
baking spray with flour
2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons strawberry-flavored gelatin, such as Jell-O (from
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon baking soda
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 cups granulated sugar
3 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 ½ cups whole buttermilk
1 ½ cups unsalted butter, softened
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
4 cups powdered sugar, sifted
2 tablespoons heavy cream, or more as needed
25 golden Oreo cookies
⅔ cup freeze-dried strawberries
⅛ teaspoon kosher salt
4 tablespoons melted unsalted butter

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2
(8-inch) round cake pans with baking spray with flour and
line bottoms with parchment. To make the cake: Whisk flour,
gelatin, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a
bowl. Beat butter at medium speed until creamy, 2 to 3
minutes in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle
attachment. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and
fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on
low speed and scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until
just combined. Beat in vanilla. Add flour mixture in 3
additions alternately with buttermilk, beginning and ending
with flour mixture and beating on low speed just until
combined after each addition. Divide batter evenly between
prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden
pick inserted in center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
Cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes; remove cakes
from pans and cool completely on a wire rack, 1 to 1 ½
hours. To make the frosting: Add butter and salt to the bowl
of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on
medium speed until creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat in vanilla.
Gradually add powdered sugar, alternately with cream,
beating on low speed until completely incorporated and
smooth. Increase mixer speed to medium-high and beat until
smooth and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. To make the crumble
mixture: Place cookies, strawberries, and salt in a food
processor and pulse until slightly chunky (bits of
strawberry and cookie should still be visible), about 12
pulses. Drizzle in butter and pulse about 5 times to
combine. Trim tops of cakes with a serrated knife if needed
to make flat on top. Place 1 cake layer on serving platter;
spread evenly with 1 cup frosting. Top with remaining cake
layer. Spread top and sides of cake with the remaining
frosting. Sprinkle crumble mixture over top and sides of
cake, pressing lightly to adhere until completely covered.
Chill cake for 1 hour before slicing.
