NYC Deli Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwich


Ingredients
4 strips bacon
2 rolls
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 large eggs,
4 slices American cheese
ketchup, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes.
Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Melt 2 tablespoons
butter in a large nonstick pan or griddle over low heat. Add
Kaiser rolls, cut sides down, and toast until lightly
golden, about 3 minutes. Remove and set aside. For each
sandwich, melt 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet. Pour half
the eggs into the pan, and cook as if making an omelet,
pushing eggs aside and lifting to allow uncooked egg to run
underneath. Layer 1 slice of cheese, 2 slices bacon, and 1
slice cheese onto half of the cooked egg, and fold the other
half over the top. Add this to a toasted Kaiser roll, and
wrap the roll in foil to steam. Repeat with remaining
sandwich ingredients. Slice in half and serve with ketchup.
