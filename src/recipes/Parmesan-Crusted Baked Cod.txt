Parmesan-Crusted Baked Cod


Ingredients
4 (6 ounce cod loins
1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon parsley
1/2 cup buttermilk (see Note)
cooking spray
lemon wedges (optional)
fresh parsley sprigs (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
baking pan with foil, and place a baking rack in the pan
over the foil. Pat cod loins dry with paper towels. Combine
panko crumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, paprika, salt, pepper,
and minced fresh parsley on a plate. Mix with a fork until
well blended. Pour buttermilk into a shallow dish and place
beside the plate with crumbs. Dip each cod loin into the
buttermilk, and then place on the crumbs. Scoop crumbs on
top of each cod loin and pat firmly, to coat both sides.
Place crumb-coated cod on the rack in the prepared pan. Add
any remaining crumbs to the top of the cod loins, and spray
with butter-flavored cooking spray. Bake in the center of
the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the
thickness of the cod loins. Test for doneness with an
instant-read thermometer. Cod is done with an internal
temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve with
lemon wedges and additional fresh parsley, if desired.
