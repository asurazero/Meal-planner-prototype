Cooking Instructions

To make the crÃªpes: Combine milk, water, eggs, sugar, and
salt in a blender; blend on medium speed until smooth, about
10 seconds. Add flour and blend until smooth, about 5 more
seconds. Add 2 tablespoons of the melted butter and orange
zest; pulse until incorporated, about 3 (1-second) pulses.
Cover blender and place in refrigerator; let rest for 15
minutes. Remove crÃªpe batter from fridge. Heat a 6-inch
nonstick skillet or crÃªpe pan over medium heat. Add 1/2
teaspoon of the melted butter and swirl to coat skillet. Add
2 tablespoons batter and swirl to coat bottom of skillet.
Cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is lightly golden, and
the top is still a little moist, about 1 minute. Swirl
skillet to loosen crÃªpe and gently flip with a spatula and
your fingers. Cook until golden, about 30 seconds. Transfer
to a plate. Repeat with remaining butter and batter. To make
the orange sauce: Combine orange juice, white sugar, and
orange zest in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook,
stirring often, until sugar is dissolved and the liquid
starts to bubble, 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually add butter,
piece by piece, stirring constantly, until it is melted and
fully incorporated. Let sauce come back up to a simmer and
let simmer until slightly syrupy, stirring occasionally,
about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in orange liqueur and salt.
Remove from the heat. Fold each crÃªpe in half, then half
again to make a triangle. Dip the folded crÃªpes into the hot
orange sauce. Place on a serving platter. Repeat with
remaining crÃªpes, overlapping each crÃªpe so they are facing
the same direction. To serve, pour orange liqueur into the
skillet with the remaining orange sauce and place over
medium-high. If it does not ignite automatically, use a
long-stemmed lighter and carefully set the liqueur on fire.
Let it burn for about 30 seconds. Pour the flaming liqueur
over the crÃªpes on the platter and serve immediately with
ice cream.
