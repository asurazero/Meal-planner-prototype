Lemon Cranberry Bread


Ingredients
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 extra large eggs
2 tablespoons fresh lemon zest
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup dried cranberries
1 ounce cream cheese
1 cup confectioners sugar
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons milk
1 pinch salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Generously butter an 8-1/2x4-1/2-inch loaf pan, and line the
bottom with parchment paper. For bread, whisk together
sugar, buttermilk, oil, eggs, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt,
and vanilla in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Add
in 2 cups flour, baking powder, and baking soda and mix
until incorporated. Toss cranberries with about 1 1/2
teaspoons flour in a small bowl until coated. Fold
cranberries into batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into
the center of the loaf comes out with just a few moist
crumbs, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool bread in the pan for 20
minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely. For
icing, beat cream cheese, confectionerâ€™s sugar, lemon juice,
milk, and pinch of salt together in a bowl with an electric
mixer until fully smooth and combined. Add more milk if
needed for thinner icing, 1/2 teaspoon at a time. Spread
glaze evenly over the top of cooled loaf.
