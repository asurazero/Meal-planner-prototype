One Pan Spicy Soy Noodles with Chicken


Ingredients
1 1/4 pounds tenders, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups water, plus more as needed
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons oil, divided
2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon ginger
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more for garnish to taste
8 ounces linguine pasta
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons sesame seeds
3 green onions, thinly sliced

Cooking Instructions

Season chicken with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and
pepper. Whisk together 1 1/2 cups water with soy sauce and
vinegar in a 2 cup measuring cup or bowl. Set aside. Heat 1
tablespoon oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high
heat. Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until
browned on all sides (Chicken will not be cooked through at
this point). Remove chicken from skillet and set aside. Add
remaining neutral oil and sesame oil to skillet. Add garlic
and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring
constantly. Stir in crushed red pepper. Add pasta and stir
to coat in garlic mixture. Add reserved soy sauce mixture
and stir until everything is well incorporated, scraping any
browned bits from bottom of skillet. Bring mixture to a boil
and reduce to simmer. Add chicken and any accumulated juices
into skillet along with brown sugar. Stir and cook, stirring
occasionally, until pasta is cooked and sauce is thickened,
10 to 12 minutes. Add additional water as needed to keep
mixture saucy until pasta is cooked. Stir in green onions,
sesame seeds and more crushed red pepper if desired.
