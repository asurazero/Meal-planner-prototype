Butter Basted Rib Eye Steak


Ingredients
1 1 pound rib eye steak
salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
2 Tablespoons garlic and herb salted butter (such as KerrygoldÂ®)

Cooking Instructions

Remove steak from package, pat dry, and place on a plate.
Refrigerate, uncovered, for 2 hours before cooking. Heat a
heavy skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Sprinkle
steak thoroughly with salt and pepper. Trim off any extra
fat from steak. Place steak in skillet with fattest side
down; cook until fat is browned, about 2 minutes. Continue
cooking until steak is browned, about 2 minutes. Add butter
to skillet and cook until butter is browned. Turn steak over
and cook, basting with browned butter, for 2 minutes more.
Remove from skillet to a plate. Tent with foil, and rest
steak for 7 minutes to absorb juice. Serve steak with a pat
of butter.
