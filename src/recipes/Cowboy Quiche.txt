Cowboy Quiche


Ingredients
1 deep dish pie crust
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 large yellow onion, thinly sliced
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (optional)
4 slices bacon
4 large eggs
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 cup sharp Cheddar cheese

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C ). Prick crust bottom and sides with a fork.
Place crust on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake crust in the
preheated oven for 5 minutes. Set aside. Leave oven on.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat;
add onions, and saute until deep golden brown, about 20
minutes. Season with salt and cayenne. Line a small bowl
with a paper towel, then add onions to cool and drain. In
the same skillet, cook bacon until just cooked, but not yet
crisp. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Crumble
when cool enough to handle. Set aside. Whisk eggs and cream
together in a bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, and
cayenne pepper. Sprinkle onions into the bottom of crust,
then cover with crumbled bacon. Scatter Cheddar cheese
evenly over the top. Pour egg mixture into the pie shell.
Bake quiche in the preheated oven on the rimmed baking sheet
until a sharp knife inserted near the center comes out
clean, 30 to 45 minutes. Check for doneness at 30 minutes.
If crust is getting too brown, lightly cover the dish with
foil. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
