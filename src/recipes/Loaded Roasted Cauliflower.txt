Loaded Roasted Cauliflower


Ingredients
4 slices bacon
1 head cauliflower
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1 cup sharp Cheddar cheese
2 green onion tops, sliced
1/3 cup ranch salad dressing

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Cook bacon in a large
skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 8 minutes.
Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, and reserve bacon
grease. Place cauliflower florets in a large mixing bowl.
Add garlic powder and black pepper. Pour reserved bacon
grease over the top. Toss to coat. Pour cauliflower mixture
on prepared baking sheet and spread into an even layer.
Roast in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Sprinkle cheese
over cauliflower and continue to roast until cheese is
melted, about 2 minutes more. Top with bacon and green
onions. Drizzle ranch dressing over the top and serve
immediately.
