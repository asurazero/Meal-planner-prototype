Slow Cooker Greek Yogurt Chicken


Ingredients
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste

Cooking Instructions

Place chicken into a 6 quart slower cooker. Mix together
yogurt, lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, basil,
oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, and black
pepper until thoroughly combined. Add half of yogurt mixture
to chicken, and toss to coat. Reserve and refrigerate
remaining yogurt mixture to use later. Cover and cook on Low
until chicken is tender, 4 to 5 hours. Remove chicken from
slow cooker and roughly chop. If desired, remove half (or
more) of cooking liquid from the slow cooker to make a
thicker, less saucy final product. Otherwise, leave all the
cooking liquid in for a lot of sauce that will be on the
thinner side. Place chopped chicken back into the slow
cooker. Add a 1/4 cup of reserved yogurt mixture, and stir
to combine. Taste the sauce, and season with salt and
pepper. Place the lid back on the slow cooker and allow
chicken to warm through, about 10 minutes. Serve remaining
yogurt mixture alongside chicken, if desired.
