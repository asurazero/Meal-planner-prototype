Shrimp and Bacon Pasta Salad


Ingredients
1 pound pasta
6 slices bacon
1 pound cooked shrimp
1 red bell pepper
1 yellow bell pepper
1 cucumber
3 green onions
1 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup cherry tomatoes
1 fresh peach
Cajun seasoning

Cooking Instructions

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a
rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook,
uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to
the bite, about 10 minutes, or according to package
directions. Drain, rinse with cold water, and let cool to
room temperature, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, place bacon
in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain
bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble when cool enough to
handle. Combine pasta, shrimp, bacon, red bell pepper,
yellow bell pepper, cucumber, green onions, mayonnaise,
olive oil, cherry tomatoes, and peach in a large bowl and
mix well. Taste and season with Cajun seasoning. Refrigerate
until ready to serve.
