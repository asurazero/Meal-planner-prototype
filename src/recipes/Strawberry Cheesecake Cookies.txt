Strawberry Cheesecake Cookies


Ingredients
3 cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1 large egg, at room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup freeze-dried strawberries

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Line a small rimmed baking sheet
with parchment paper; set aside. Beat cream cheese and
powdered sugar with an electric hand mixer on medium speed
until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Scoop cream cheese
mixture into 16 portions (about 1 teaspoon each), and place
onto prepared baking sheet. Freeze, uncovered, for 15
minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) with
racks in top third and lower third positions. Line 1 large
rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside. Whisk
together melted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar
until mostly combined (mixture will look broken). Add egg
and vanilla, and whisk until mixture looks homogenous. Add
flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt to butter
mixture; whisk until almost fully incorporated and a few dry
streaks remain, about 1 minute. Fold freeze-dried
strawberries into flour mixture until fully combined and
strawberries are broken up into smaller bits. Scoop dough
into 16 portions (about 3 tablespoons each). Working with 1
dough portion at a time, use your hands to flatten dough
into a 1/2-inch thick disk. Place a frozen cream cheese ball
in center of dough disk, and carefully wrap dough around
cream cheese ball to enclose. Transfer cookie to prepared
baking sheet. Repeat procedure with remaining dough and
cream cheese balls. Chill cookies, uncovered, 30 minutes.
Line a second large rimmed baking sheet with parchment
paper. Transfer 8 of the cookies to the second sheet,
spacing all cookies about 1 inch apart. Bake in preheated
oven until edges are golden and the tops are set, about 12
minutes, rotating baking sheets between top and bottom racks
halfway through bake time. Let cookies cool on the baking
sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack and
cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
