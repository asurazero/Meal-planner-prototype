Brown Butter Crinkle Cake


Ingredients
1 cup butter
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 cinnamon stick
1 (16-ounce) package phyllo dough, thawed
3/4 cup whole milk
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the
bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper. For
brown butter, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium
heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until browned,
fragrant, and foamy with brown bits in it, 5 to 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and pour into a small heat-safe bowl. Let
cool. For syrup, stir together sugar, water, lemon juice,
and cinnamon stick in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil,
stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat to low; simmer until
slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile,
stack 2 phyllo sheets; starting with a short end, fold
accordion-style into a strip, using approximately 1 1/2-inch
folds. Arrange folded phyllo along the short end of prepared
pan. (Keep remaining phyllo covered with a clean, damp
kitchen towel while you work.) Repeat stacking and folding
with remaining phyllo, evenly spacing strips in the pan.
Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven. Stir cooled brown
butter, then drizzle over phyllo. Bake for 10 minutes more.
Meanwhile, whisk together milk, eggs, vanilla, and salt in a
2-cup liquid measuring cup until combined. Pour egg mixture
evenly over phyllo. Bake until golden, 35 to 40 minutes.
Pour syrup over the warm cake (discard cinnamon stick). Let
cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Cut into 20 squares.
Serve warm.
