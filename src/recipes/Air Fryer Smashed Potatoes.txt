Air Fryer Smashed Potatoes


Ingredients
8 ounces baby gold potatoes
1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Meanwhile, place potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl: cook on
high until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer potatoes
to a baking sheet and use the bottom of a small glass to
gently "smash" them to 3/4 or 1/2-inch thick. The thinner
you flatten the potatoes, the crispier they will be. Brush
melted butter over the tops of smashed potatoes. Season with
salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Place potatoes in the
basket of the air fryer in an even layer; cook until golden
and crisp, about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve
hot.
