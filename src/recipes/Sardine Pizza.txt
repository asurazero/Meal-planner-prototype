Sardine Pizza


Ingredients
1 pound pizza dough
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon seasoning
1/4 cup pizza sauce
8 slices mozzarella cheese, or more to taste
1/4 cup cherry tomatoes
10 sardines
1 1/2 teaspoons oregano
1 large egg (optional)
3 leaves basil, torn
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15
minutes. Shape pizza dough into a disc. Reduce the flame on
half the grill burners to Low, to create areas of direct and
indirect heat. Carefully place dough onto the grill over
direct heat. Close the cover. Let dough grill until the
bottom is just barely cooked and shows char marks, 1 to 3
minutes. Use tongs to flip pizza dough over; move to the
indirect heat. Brush dough with olive oil, and sprinkle with
Greek seasoning. Place mozzarella slices, tomatoes, and
sardines on pizza. Sprinkle oregano evenly over the pizza.
Crack open egg and place in center of the pizza. Grill until
cheese is melted, and egg white is no longer clear, about 3
minutes. Carefully remove pizza from the grill. Sprinkle
with torn basil; squeeze lemon juice over the pizza.
