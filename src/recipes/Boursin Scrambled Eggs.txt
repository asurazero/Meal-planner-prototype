Boursin Scrambled Eggs


Ingredients
4 large eggs
3 tablespoons half-and-half
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 tablespoons garlic and fine herbs spreadable cheese (such as BoursinÂ®)
ground black pepper
chopped fresh parsley or chives, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Whisk eggs, half-and-half, and a pinch of salt together in a
small bowl. Melt butter in a medium nonstick pan over
medium-low heat. When butter starts to bubble, pour in egg
mixture. Using a silicone spatula, gently swirl the eggs
around in circles from the outside in, without stopping,
until you start to see small curds, about 20 to 30 seconds.
Switch from making circles to making long sweeps across the
pan until you see larger curds, about 20 seconds. When eggs
are about 75% cooked, gently fold in cheese. The eggs now
should be softly set and still a little runny in places.
Remove the skillet from the heat, and set aside for about 20
to 35 seconds to allow the residual heat to finish cooking
to your preferred consistency. Garnish with parsley or
chives, and serve immediately.
