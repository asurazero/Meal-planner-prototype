Warm Broccoli Caesar Salad


Ingredients
8 cups fresh broccoli florets
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/4 teaspoons black pepper
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 cup shaved Parmesan cheese
3 hard-cooked eggs
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 garlic clove
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
4 slices bacon
1/3 cup panko

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200
degrees C). Spread out broccoli on a large rimmed baking
sheet. Toss with 2 tablespoons of the canola oil, 3/4
teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper
until evenly coated. Roast in the preheated oven until
broccoli is bright green and browned in spots, 18 to 20
minutes. Meanwhile, combine 1/2 cup oil, 1/4 cup Parmesan
cheese, eggs, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic,
Dijon mustard, 3/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 3/4 teaspoon
salt in a blender; process until smooth, about 2 minutes.
Refrigerate until ready to serve. Add bacon to a large
skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally,
until crispy, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon,
transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Reserve 1 tablespoon
of bacon fat in skillet and do not wipe clean; discard
remaining drippings. Add panko and remaining 1/4 teaspoon
black pepper to skillet over low heat; cook, stirring
constantly, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from
heat. Transfer broccoli to a large serving bowl. Top with
panko, bacon, and remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Drizzle with
desired amount of Caesar dressing. Refrigerate remaining
Caesar dressing for up to 4 days.
