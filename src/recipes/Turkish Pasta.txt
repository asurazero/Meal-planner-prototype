Turkish Pasta


Ingredients
2 cups Greek yogurt
3 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons kosher salt
5 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons paprika
1 pound fusilli pasta
1 1/4 pounds ground round
1 cup onion
1/4 teaspoon curry powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 pint grape tomatoes
1 bunch flat leaf parsley,

Cooking Instructions

Stir together yogurt, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl
until well blended and set aside. Melt butter in a small
skillet or saucepan and stir in 1/2 teaspoon paprika and
salt to taste. Keep warm. Bring a large pot of salted water
to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 9
minutes; drain. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-
high heat. Add ground beef and cook, breaking up meat with a
spatula, until beginning to brown. Add onion, remaining
paprika, curry powder, onion powder, remaining salt, and
pepper and cook until browned, crumbly, and slightly crispy.
Divide pasta among serving plates and top evenly with yogurt
mixture. Top with ground beef mixture and drizzle evenly
with butter mixture. Sprinkle the top with tomatoes and
parsley.
