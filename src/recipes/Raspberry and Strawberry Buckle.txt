2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
¼ teaspoon salt

1 pint fresh strawberries
1 pint fresh raspberries
½ cup white sugar

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease one
11x7 inch glass baking dish. Cream 1/2 cup of the butter or
margarine with 1/2 cup of the white sugar until light, beat
in the egg. Add the baking powder and the salt. Stir in the
2 cups of flour one cup at a time alternating with the
yogurt. Spread batter into the prepared pan. Arrange fruit
over top of batter. Sprinkle topping over fruit. To Make
Topping: Mix together 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup flour,
1/2 cup butter or margarine, and the cinnamon until the
mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Bake at 375 degrees F (190
degrees C) for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the cake is
top is puffed and nicely browned. Allow cake to cool. You
can serve it directly from the baking dish or for a more
attractive presentation, I cut it up into squares and
arrange them on a platter.
