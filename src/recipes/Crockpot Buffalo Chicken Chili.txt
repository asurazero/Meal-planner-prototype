Crockpot Buffalo Chicken Chili


Ingredients
2 (15-ounce) cans cans
2 (14.5-ounce) fire-roasted diced tomatoes with garlic
1 cup yellow onion
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1/4 cup B B
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1 cup plain whole-milk strained (Greek-style) yogurt
1 1/2 tablespoons ranch dressing mix
6 ounces cream cheese, cubed and softened
1/2 cup scallions
tortilla chips for serving (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. In a 6-quart slow cooker, stir
together beans, diced tomatoes with garlic, onion, bell
pepper, hot sauce, chili powder, and garlic powder; nestle
chicken in bean mixture. Cover and cook until chicken is
tender, about 3 hours on HIGH and 5 hours on LOW. Meanwhile,
stir together yogurt and ranch dressing mix in a small bowl
until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Remove chicken from slow cooker and shred it using two
forks. Return shredded chicken to slow cooker. Stir in cream
cheese until smooth and well combined. Cover and cook on
HIGH until warmed through, about 30 minutes. Serve with a
dollop of yogurt mixture. Garnish with scallions and serve
with tortilla chips, if desired.
