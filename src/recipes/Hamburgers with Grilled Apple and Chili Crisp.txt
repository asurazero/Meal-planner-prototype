Hamburgers with Grilled Apple and Chili Crisp


Ingredients
2 red apples
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons chili crisp
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 (1/3-inch) slices red onion
4 hamburger buns
1/4 cup mayonnaise

Cooking Instructions

Slice 1 apple using a mandoline slicer to create 8
(1/4-inch-thick) slices. Shred any remaining scraps plus all
or part of the second apple to get 1/2 cup shredded apple.
Squeeze shredded apple to extract some of the moisture.
Reserve any remaining apple for another use. Preheat an
outdoor grill to medium heat (350 to 375 degrees F (175 to
190 degrees C)). Combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, 1
tablespoon chili crisp, salt, and the 1/2 cup shredded apple
in a bowl. Shape into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) patties, 4 inches
in diameter. Mixture may be wet so be sure to tightly pack
patties. Oil the grill grate. Grill patties, covered,
carefully turning halfway through, until an instant-read
thermometer inserted into centers of patties reads 160
degrees F (71 degrees C), 10 to 13 minutes. Grill onion
slices, turning halfway through, 8 to 10 minutes. Grill
apple slices, turning halfway through, 4 to 5 minutes. If
you like, grill buns, cut sides down, until toasted, 1 to 2
minutes. When onions are cool enough to handle, separate
rings. Stir mayonnaise and remaining 2 teaspoons chili crisp
together in a small bowl. Spread buns with mayonnaise
mixture and fill with patties, onion, and apple slices.
Serve with additional chili crisp
