Fall Harvest Orzo Pasta Salad


Ingredients
8 slices bacon
1 small butternut squash
1 small red onion
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon fresh thyme
1 pound orzo pasta
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 tablespoon mustard
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
8 ounces Brussels sprouts
3/4 cup walnuts
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup feta cheese (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
rimmed baking sheet with foil or parchment; place bacon on
the sheet. Bake bacon in the preheated oven until crisp,
about 10 minutes. Remove bacon from tray and drain on paper
towels. Reserve drippings in the pan. Increase the oven
temperature 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Add butternut
squash, onion, 2 tablespoons oil, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2
teaspoon pepper, and thyme to the pan with bacon drippings
and toss to coat. Roast squash in the preheated oven until
browned, about 20 minutes. Set aside. Meanwhile, bring a
large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in
the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet
firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside to
cool. For vinaigrette, add vinegar, maple syrup, mustard,
garlic powder, remaining salt, and remaining pepper into a
bowl. Whisk in remaining 1/4 cup olive oil until well
combined. Set aside. Add pasta, Brussels sprouts, walnuts,
cranberries, and vinaigrette to a large bowl and toss to
combine. Gently stir in cooked vegetables and bacon. Serve
immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve.
