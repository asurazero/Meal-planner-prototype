Giant Lazy Meatballs


Ingredients
4 large slices white bread
1/2 cup milk
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1/3 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley (optional)
2 large eggs,
2 cups tomato sauce
2 ounces Monterey Jack cheese
1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1 tablespoon Italian parsley

Cooking Instructions

Crumble bread into a bowl and mix in milk thoroughly using a
fork. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. Combine beef and pork
in a large bowl and mix well using 2 forks. Add salt, black
pepper, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, olive
oil, Parmesan, parsley, eggs, and the breadcrumb mixture.
Mix using 2 forks until everything is evenly combined. Wrap
and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Preheat the oven
to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a roasting
pan or baking dish. Using damp hands, roll 4 giant
meatballs, and place in the prepared pan. Bake in the
preheated oven until an instant read thermometer inserted
near the center of meatballs reads 160 to 165 degrees F (71
to 74 degrees C), 40 to 45 minutes. Remove meatballs from
the oven, and spoon tomato sauce evenly over meatballs.
Sprinkle first with Monterey Jack cheese, and then with
Parmigiano-Reggiano. Return meatballs to the oven, and bake
until sauce is hot and cheese is melted, 5 to 10 minutes
more. Top with parsley and serve.
