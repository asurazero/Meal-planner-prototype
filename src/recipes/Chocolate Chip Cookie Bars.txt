Chocolate Chip Cookie Bars


Ingredients
baking spray baking spray
1 1/3 cups white sugar
2/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1 cup unsalted butter
2 large eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups mini semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gather
all ingredients. Line bottom and sides of a 13x9-inch baking
pan with heavy duty aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang
on all sides, lightly spray with baking spray; set aside.
Beat together white sugar, brown sugar, and butter with a
stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment on medium speed
until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape
down sides as needed. With mixer running on low, add eggs,
one at a time, beating until just combined after each
addition. Beat in vanilla until just combined. Whisk
together flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a
medium bowl until combined. With stand mixer running on low
speed, gradually beat in flour mixture until almost fully
incorporated, about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides
as needed. Stir in chocolate chips and toasted walnuts until
combined. Transfer dough into prepared baking pan, spreading
into an even layer. Bake in preheated oven until golden
brown and set, about 40 minutes, rotating baking pan front
to back halfway through. Let cookie cool completely in pan
on wire rack, about 1 hour. Using foil overhang as handles,
lift cookie out of pan. Cut into 24 (about 2-inch) squares.
