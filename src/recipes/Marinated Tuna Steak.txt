Marinated Tuna Steak


Ingredients
¼ cup orange juice
¼ cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 clove garlic, minced
½ teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
4 (4 ounce) tuna steaks

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Mix orange juice, soy sauce, olive
oil, parsley, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and pepper
together in a large non-reactive dish until well combined.
Place tuna steaks in marinade and turn to coat. Cover the
dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for
at least 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat
and lightly oil the grate. Remove tuna steaks from the
marinade and shake off excess; reserve marinade for basting.
Cook tuna steaks on the preheated grill for 5 to 6 minutes;
flip steaks and baste with reserved marinade. Cook for an
additional 5 minutes, or to desired doneness. Discard any
remaining marinade. Serve and enjoy!
