Creamy Chicken Piccata Pasta Bake


Ingredients
1 pound penne pasta
1 lemon
1 tablespoon butter
1 shallot
2 cloves garlic
2 (15-ounce) jars Alfredo sauce
1 cup ricotta cheese
3/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 (3-ounce) jar capers,
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 1/2 cups cooked chicken
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley,

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(180 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bring a
large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and
cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Zest and juice the lemon to
yield 1 teaspoon zest and 3 tablespoons juice. Melt butter
in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic.
Cook and stir until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk together
cooked shallot and garlic, lemon juice, Alfredo sauce,
ricotta cheese, broth, capers, and pepper in a large bowl.
Add penne and chicken; toss to combine. Spread in the
prepared dish. Toss together Parmesan cheese and lemon zest
in a small bowl. Spread over the pasta mixture. Bake in the
preheated oven until hot and bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes.
Garnish with parsley.
