Margarita Bars


Ingredients
cooking spray
1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/3 cup white sugar
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
10 large egg yolks
2 (14 ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk
4 teaspoons lime zest
3/4 cup lime juice
1/4 cup tequila
2 tablespoons orange liqueur
sea salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Line a 9-inch square baking pan with
aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides.
Lightly coat with cooking spray; set aside. Stir together
graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and 1/4
teaspoon of the salt in a bowl until fully combined and
resembles wet sand. Transfer to prepared baking pan, and
firmly press into an even layer on bottom of pan. Bake in
the preheated oven until just golden brown and fragrant, 8
to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool slightly,
about 5 minutes. Whisk together yolks, condensed milk, lime
zest and juice, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large
bowl until smooth. Add tequila and orange liqueur, and whisk
until fully combined, about 30 seconds. Pour over slightly
cooled crust. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set
and center has a slight jiggle, 25 to 28 minutes. Remove
from oven; let cool to room temperature in pan on wire rack,
about 1 hour. Place in freezer, uncovered, until chilled and
set, at least 2 hours or up to 12 hours. Using excess foil
as handles, remove bars from pan, transfer to a cutting
board; cut evenly into 16 bars, trimming edges, as desired.
Garnish with flaky sea salt and additional lime zest. Serve.
