Baked Pumpkin Polenta


Ingredients
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
8 to 10 sage leaves
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
5 1/2 cups water
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
1/4 cup milk
1 1/2 cups Parmigiano Reggiano or pecorino cheese
2/3 cup Monterey Jack

Cooking Instructions

Add olive oil to a saucepan set over medium-high heat; add
butter, and heat until melted. Toss in sage leaves and fry
until they are dark green and have stopped bubbling, 20 to
30 seconds. Turn off the heat; remove sage leaves to a paper
towel-lined plate and set aside. Fried sage leaves can be
stored in the refrigerator and used to garnish the tops
later. Add pumpkin to the pan, pour in water, and turn heat
to high. Whisk and bring to a boil. Season with salt and
pepper. With mixture boiling, slowly sprinkle in cornmeal,
whisking constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook,
stirring occasionally, until cornmeal is creamy, soft, and
no longer gritty, about 25 minutes. Turn off heat; add
cayenne, milk, and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Whisk
thoroughly until evenly combined. Generously grease a
9x9-inch cake pan with olive oil; spread polenta evenly into
the pan. Let cool to room temperature. Wrap and chill in the
refrigerator for at least 3 hours. Preheat the oven to 425
degrees F (220 degrees C). Invert cold, firm polenta onto a
cutting board and cut into 8 equal portions. Transfer to a
lined baking sheet, and top each piece with grated Monterey
Jack cheese. Sprinkle tops with paprika or cayenne, if
desired. Bake in the preheated oven until polenta is heated
through, and the edges are turning golden-brown, about 30
minutes. Garnish tops with fried sage and serve.
