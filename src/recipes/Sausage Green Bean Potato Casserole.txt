Sausage Green Bean Potato Casserole


Ingredients
1 pound chicken apple sausage
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 onion,
1 tablespoon garlic
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup half-and-half
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans
1 1/2 pounds potatoes
1 pound carrots
1 1/2 cups fried onions

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and grease
a 3-quart baking dish. Brown sausage pieces in a nonstick
skillet over medium heat, 3 to 5 minutes; remove from the
pan to a large bowl. In the same skillet, melt butter over
medium heat. Add onions, and cook, stirring, until soft,
about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook another 30 seconds.
Stir in thyme; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour
over onions and garlic, and stir until flour has been
absorbed, about 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth and
half-and-half. Bring to a boil, while stirring, then reduce
to a simmer and cook, stirring, until sauce thickens and
coats the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet
from the heat. Add green beans, potatoes, and carrots to the
bowl with sausage; add sauce and stir to coat all
ingredients with the sauce. Transfer mixture to the prepared
baking dish. Cover with foil. Bake in the preheated oven for
45 minutes. Remove foil, stir, and sprinkle fried onions on
top. Continue to bake until casserole is hot and bubbly and
onions have crisped slightly, about 20 minutes more. Serve
warm.
