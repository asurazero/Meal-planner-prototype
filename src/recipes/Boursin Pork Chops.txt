Boursin Pork Chops


Ingredients
4 pork chops
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/4 cup shallots
1 1/2 cups mushrooms
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 (5.2 ounce) package shallot and chive cheese spread, such as BoursinÂ®
chives,

Cooking Instructions

Pat chops dry with paper towels, and season each side with
salt, pepper, and granulated garlic. If using powdered
garlic, use a bit more. Heat oil and butter in a large
nonstick skillet over medium high heat, until butter stops
sizzling. Add seasoned pork chops and brown on both sides,
about 3 minutes per side. Remove chops from skillet and keep
warm. Add shallots and mushrooms to the same skillet. Reduce
heat to medium and cook, stirring, until mushrooms begin to
soften and release moisture, about 5 minutes. Season with
just a pinch of salt, or to taste. Nestle chops back in the
skillet, along with any accumulated juices, and bring some
of the vegetables over the top of chops. Cover, reduce heat
to low, and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Turn heat back up to
medium, stack chops on one side of skillet, stir cream into
pan drippings, and add Boursin. Stir continually, until
cheese is melts and sauce is bubbling, about 2 minutes.
Redistribute chops in the skillet and cook until an instant
read thermometer inserted near the center reads 145 degrees
F (63 degrees C), about 5 minutes more. Garnish with chives
and serve warm.
