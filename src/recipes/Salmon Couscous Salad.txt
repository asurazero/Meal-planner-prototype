Salmon Couscous Salad


Ingredients
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup pesto
1 lemon, juiced
1 clove garlic
ground black pepper to taste
1 (5.8 ounce) package herb and garlic couscous
1/2 pound salmon filet, with skin
1 teaspoon seasoning, such as
1 teaspoon butter
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 oma tomatoes, seeded and chopped
2 cups arugula and spinach salad mix, roughly chopped
2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons pepitas

Cooking Instructions

Add mayonnaise, buttermilk, pesto, lemon juice, and garlic
to the bowl of a food processor. Blend until smooth. Season
to taste with black pepper. Set dressing aside. Meanwhile,
heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Season salmon with
Greek seasoning. Cut salmon into two filets. Melt butter in
a skillet over medium heat and add olive oil. Place salmon,
skin side down, in the hot skillet. Cook until salmon flakes
easily with a fork, about 8 minutes. Bring water to a boil
in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir couscous into the
water. Cover saucepan and let stand until water is absorbed
completely, about 10 minutes. To assemble, place salad
mixture into 2 dinner bowls, and sprinkle chopped tomatoes
over the salad. Fluff couscous with a fork. Mound couscous
in the center of each bowl. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese around
couscous. Place a salmon filet to the side of the couscous.
Pour 1 to 2 tablespoons pesto dressing on top of dish.
Sprinkle with pepitas. Serve immediately.
