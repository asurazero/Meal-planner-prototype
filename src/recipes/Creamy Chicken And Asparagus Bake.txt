Creamy Chicken And Asparagus Bake


Ingredients
1/4 cup all purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon granulated garlic
4 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
3 tablespoons chicken broth
1/4 cup shallot
1/4 cup dry white wine
3 thyme sprigs, plus leaves for garnish
1 cup chicken broth
1 pound asparagus,
1/2 cup creme fraiche or sour cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C). Whisk together flour and granulated garlic
in a shallow bowl or baking dish until combined. Sprinkle
chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Working with 1
chicken breast at a time, dredge chicken in flour mixture to
coat both sides, and shake off excess; set aside on a large
plate. Heat oil and butter in a large ovenproof skillet over
medium-high. Once butter is melted and shimmering, add
chicken breasts to skillet, and cook until golden brown on
both sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a clean plate. Do
not wipe skillet clean. While chicken browns, transfer
remaining flour mixture to a small bowl. Add 3 tablespoons
chicken broth, and whisk until smooth to make a slurry; set
aside until ready to use. Reduce heat under skillet to
medium; add shallot, and cook, stirring constantly, until
softened, about 30 seconds. Add wine, scraping up browned
bits from the bottom of skillet, about 1 minute. Stir in
thyme sprigs and 1 cup broth. Gradually whisk in slurry
mixture until combined; bring to a simmer around edges of
skillet over medium-high. Remove skillet from heat. Add
browned chicken to the skillet; arrange asparagus around
chicken, and immediately transfer skillet to the preheated
oven. Bake in the preheated oven until asparagus is tender
and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken
registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove from the oven, and divide chicken evenly among 4
plates. Stir crème fraîche and Parmesan into asparagus and
broth mixture until fully combined. Spoon asparagus and
cream sauce over chicken. Garnish with thyme leaves.
