Tomato Basil Chicken


Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken breasts
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon talian seasoning
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 shallot, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 ( 28 can crushed tomatoes
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon chili paste
salt to taste
1/4 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped
1/2 cup half-and-half

Cooking Instructions

Cut chicken breasts in half horizontally to create cutlets.
Season chicken with salt, Italian seasoning, and paprika.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high
heat. When oil is hot, brown chicken on both sides until
golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove chicken from
skillet and keep warm. Add remaining olive oil to the same
skillet, add shallot, and saut√© until soft, about 3 minutes.
Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in
tomato paste, and cook for 2 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes
and chicken broth, scraping up any browned bits from the
bottom of the skillet. Simmer until sauce is reduced and
slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Season the sauce with
Calabrian chile paste and salt; stir in basil and half-and-
half. Return chicken with any accumulated juices to the
skillet, and simmer chicken in the sauce until an instant-
read thermometer, inserted near the center of chicken, reads
165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the
skillet from the heat and serve immediately.
