Full English Breakfast


Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) can baked beans
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon HP sauce
3 slices bacon
2 bangers (British sausages)
1 bunch cherry tomatoes on the vine
5 whole cremini mushrooms
2 large eggs

Cooking Instructions

Place beans in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add
ketchup and HP sauce, and heat until warmed through, about 5
minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and add
bacon and sausages. Cook until sausage is browned and bacon
is cooked to your taste, about 10 minutes. Remove from the
pan and set aside. Add tomatoes and mushrooms to the
skillet, and sear in bacon fat for 2 minutes; remove from
the pan. Add 1 cup water to the pan, crack in eggs, and
simmer until whites are opaque and yolks are still runny.
Spoon beans onto a plate, and arrange eggs, bacon, bangers,
tomatoes, and mushrooms around them.
