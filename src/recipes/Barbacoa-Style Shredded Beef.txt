Barbacoa-Style Shredded Beef


Ingredients
1 (3 pound) beef chuck roast, cut into 6 to 8 chunks
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
½ cup beef broth
¼ cup apple cider vinegar
¼ cup fresh lime juice
4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon ground cloves
3 large bay leaves

Cooking Instructions

Season beef chunks with salt and pepper on all sides. Heat
oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in
batches, cook and stir beef until browned, 4 to 5 minutes
per batch. Transfer browned beef to a slow cooker. Mix
broth, vinegar, lime juice, chipotle peppers, garlic, cumin,
oregano, and cloves together in a bowl until well combined.
Season mixture with salt and pepper and pour over beef in
the slow cooker. Stir in bay leaves. Cook on Low until beef
is fork-tender, 8 to 10 hours. Discard bay leaves. Remove
beef from the cooker and shred using two forks. Return beef
to the slow cooker and stir to coat with sauce. Let marinate
for at least 10 minutes before serving.
