Chef John's Pumpkin Bread


Ingredients
cooking spray
½ cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
⅛ teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
⅛ teaspoon ground allspice
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
¾ cup chopped toasted walnuts

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a
9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Mix butter and sugar
in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Whisk in eggs one at
a time until combined. Whisk in the pumpkin puree, cinnamon,
Chinese five-spice powder, and allspice until combined. Stir
flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda into the pumpkin
mixture and mix until just combined. Stir in chopped
walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the
preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
comes out clean, about 1 hour.
