Air Fryer Buffalo Wings


Ingredients
2 teaspoons sea salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound chicken wings

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine sea salt, garlic powder, mustard powder, coriander,
smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper in a
shallow bowl. Dredge each chicken wing in the spice mixture
and set into the air fryer basket in one layer. Cook in the
air fryer until chicken wings are no longer pink at the bone
and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read
thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F
(74 degrees C). If wings are smaller, reduce cooking time.
