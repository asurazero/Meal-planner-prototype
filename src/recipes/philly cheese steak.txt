philly cheese steak


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an electric griddle or stovetop griddle over medium-
high heat. On one half of the griddle, place the mushrooms,
onion and pepper. On the other side, place the roast beef.
Cook and stir each group separately, chopping the beef into
smaller pieces as it cooks, and seasoning with salt and
seasoned salt. When the vegetables are tender and the beef
is hot, place the slices of provolone cheese over the beef
to melt. Turn off the griddle. Scoop the cheesy grilled beef
into sandwich rolls, and top with the onions and peppers.
