Cottage Cheese Bread


Ingredients
1 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1/4 cup water
3/4 cup egg whites or
3/4 cup whole milk cottage cheese
3 1/2 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Combine warm water and yeast in a
large bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the egg whites and cottage cheese in a
blender or food processor. Cover and blend until smooth. Add
cottage cheese mixture to the yeast mixture and whisk to
combine. Using a wooden spoon, stir flour and salt into the
wet mixture until combined (dough will be sticky). Turn
dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead about 5
minutes or until smooth but still slightly tacky, adding
additional flour as needed. Shape dough into a ball and
place in a lightly greased bowl. Cover and let rise in a
warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Line a
9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper. Punch dough down and
turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently pat and
pinch dough into a loaf shape, tucking edges underneath.
Place shaped dough, seam side down, in prepared loaf pan.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double in
size (about 30 minutes). Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C). Using a sharp knife, cut a shallow slit,
lengthwise, down the middle of the loaf. Bake until bread
sounds hollow when lightly tapped, 40 to 45 minutes. Cover
loosely with foil for the last 10 to 15 minutes to prevent
overbrowning. Immediately remove from pan and cool
completely on a wire rack before slicing. Enjoy!
