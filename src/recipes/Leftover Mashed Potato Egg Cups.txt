Leftover Mashed Potato Egg Cups


Ingredients
16 ounces mashed potatoes
5 large eggs
2 teaspoons milk
4 thin pats unsalted butter
4 tablespoons grated Cheddar cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
green onions or chives, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray 4
(6 ounce) ramekins with cooking spray. Place 4 ounces mashed
potatoes into each ramekin. Using the back of a spoon, mold
into nests, and brush with 1 lightly beaten egg. Break 1 of
the 4 remaining eggs into each ramekin. Drizzle each with
1/2 teaspoon milk, top with 1 pat of butter, and 1
tablespoon Cheddar cheese. Cook until yolk is starting to
set and cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes (cooking time
will depend on how you want your eggs cooked). Remove from
the oven, and let stand until residual heat finishes cooking
the egg whites, 1 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper,
garnish with green onions or chives, and serve immediately.
