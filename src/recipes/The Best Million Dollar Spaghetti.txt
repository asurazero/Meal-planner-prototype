The Best Million Dollar Spaghetti


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion
1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
2 cloves garlic
1 pound ground sirloin
1 pound Italian sausage
32 ounces marinara sauce
16 ounces spaghetti
5 tablespoons butter
1 cup cottage cheese
8 ounces cream cheese
1/4 cup sour cream
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
chopped parsley, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add
onion, 1 teaspoon salt, and garlic; cook until softened,
about 3 minutes. Add ground beef and sausage and cook,
crumbling with a spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir
in 3 cups marinara sauce; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to
low and simmer while pasta cooks. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large casserole
dish. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta
and cook until just tender with a bite, about 7 minutes.
Drain; return spaghetti to the pot. Stir in 3 1/2
tablespoons butter and remaining marinara sauce. Combine
cottage cheese, cream cheese, sour cream, remaining salt,
pepper, and 1 cup mozzarella in a medium bowl and stir until
well incorporated. Add half of pasta to the casserole dish.
Spread cheese mixture evenly over pasta. Add remaining
pasta; cut remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter into thin
slices, and arrange over pasta. Top with meat sauce mixture,
remaining 2 cups mozzarella, and grated Parmesan cheese.
Place casserole dish on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the
preheated oven until cheese is melted and browned and pasta
is bubbling around the edges, 40 to 50 minutes. Let stand 5
to 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with parsley if
desired.
