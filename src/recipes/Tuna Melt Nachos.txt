Tuna Melt Nachos


Ingredients
1 (5.5 ounce) jar tuna packed in olive oil,
1 small rib celery
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/3 cup mayonnaise
24 corn tortilla chips
1/2 cup pickled jalapeno rings
6 cherry tomatoes
3 ounces Monterey Jack cheese
3 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup green onions

Cooking Instructions

Break up tuna in a bowl with a fork into small flakes. Add
celery, black pepper, cayenne, and mayonnaise. Mix well,
cover, and refrigerate until needed. Preheat the oven to 475
degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with foil, and
space chips out evenly on the pan. Top each chip with a
generous rounded teaspoon tuna salad. Place a jalapeno ring
on top of tuna, followed by a slice of tomato, pressing down
lightly as you do. Top with cheese, piling it as high as
possible in the middle of each nacho. Use any extra cheese
to cover exposed areas of chips. Bake in the preheated oven
until cheese is melted and the edges of chips are turning
golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Alternately, preheat the
ovenâ€™s broiler and broil nachos for just a few minutes until
cheese melts and chip edges are golden. Scatter green onions
over the top, and serve immediately.
