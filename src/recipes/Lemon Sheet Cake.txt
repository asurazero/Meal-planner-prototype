Ingredients
2 cups cake flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
1 ⅓ cups white sugar
½ cup unsalted butter, softened
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 cup yogurt
1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tablespoon lemon zest
3 cups powdered sugar
¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
10x15-inch baking pan. To make the cake: Combine flour,
baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large
bowl. Beat sugar and butter together in another bowl until
well incorporated. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well
after each addition. Add yogurt, lemon juice, and lemon
zest. Add cake flour mixture and mix until incorporated.
Pour cake batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the
preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack
completely. To make the glaze: Mix powdered sugar and 1/4
cup plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice together in a bowl until
well combined. Pour over cooled cake.
