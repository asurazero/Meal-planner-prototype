Shakshuka for One


Ingredients
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 button mushrooms, sliced
1/4 cup red onion
1/2 cup peppers and/or sweet peppers
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/8 teaspoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 cup sauce
1/4 cup water, or more as needed
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, divided
2 tablespoons feta cheese, divided
1 large egg
1 pinch Aleppo chili flakes
sliced bread to serve alongside

Cooking Instructions

Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a small pan or skillet. Place
mushrooms in a single layer in the skillet, and sprinkle
with a pinch of salt. Top with onions, then peppers, and
another pinch of salt. Place on medium high heat, and wait
for mushrooms to start sizzling. Cook until bottoms of
mushrooms are nicely browned, about 3 minutes, and then stir
everything together and cook for 1 minute more. Add cumin,
paprika, turmeric, oregano, black pepper, and cayenne and
cook, stirring, for another 30 to 60 seconds. Stir in tomato
puree and water, and wait for mixture to simmer. Stir in
cilantro, and scatter over half the feta. Use a spoon to
make a well in the center, and transfer in the egg. Reduce
heat to medium low, cover, and cook until the egg is done to
your liking, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately topped with
Aleppo chili flakes, and the remaining olive oil, feta, and
cilantro, with bread on the side.
