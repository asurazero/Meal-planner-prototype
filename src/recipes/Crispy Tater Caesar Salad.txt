Crispy Tater Caesar Salad


Ingredients
8 ounces chicken cutlets
cooking spray
2 1/2 cups Tater Tots
2 ounces Parmesan cheese
1 cup Caesar dressing
1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest
1 teaspoon anchovy paste
1 teaspoon garlic
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
4 cups omaine lettuce
1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Set 2
shelves near the center of the oven. Spray a baking pan with
cooking spray; place frozen chicken filets on the pan. Bake
in the preheated oven on the lower-center shelf until hot
and crisp, about 20 minutes, turning filets over halfway
through heating time. When cool enough to handle, cut filets
into bite-sized pieces. Meanwhile, line a large rimmed
baking sheet with parchment paper, and add tater tots in an
even layer. Bake on upper-center shelf in the preheated oven
until tots are soft and slightly baked, 8 to 10 minutes.
Remove from oven. Spray cooking spray on the bottom of a
cup. Smash each tater tot into a flat disk with cup. Return
to the oven; bake until golden brown and crispy, 15 to 20
minutes. Remove from oven again, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup
Parmesan cheese. Bake again until cheese is melted, about 1
minute. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk
Caesar dressing, lemon juice, anchovy paste, garlic, 1/4
teaspoon black pepper, and salt together in a bowl until
smooth. Toss together lettuce, chicken, remaining 1/2 cup
Parmesan cheese and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
until well combined. Pour half the dressing into salad mix
and toss until evenly coated. Add cooled tater tots and toss
until well combined. Transfer to a serving platter, drizzle
with white balsamic vinegar, and garnish with more Parmesan
cheese. Serve immediately.
