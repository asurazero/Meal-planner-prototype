Cinnamon-Raisin French Toast Muffins


Ingredients
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2/3 cup half and half
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 cups cinnamon raisin bread
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup maple syrup, or to taste (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (180 degrees C). Butter a
standard-size 6-muffin tin. In a large mixing bowl, whisk
together half and half, eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt until
well blended. Add bread cubes to liquid mixture; stir to
coat all bread pieces. Divide batter evenly into the
prepared muffin tin. To prepare streusel, toss flour, brown
sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Cut cold butter into
small pieces, then toss with flour mixture. Using a fork or
pastry knife, cut the butter into the dry ingredients, until
the mixture looks like a combination of coarse sand and
small pebbles. Distribute streusel evenly over the 6
muffins. Bake muffins in the center of the preheated oven
until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool muffins on a rack
for 5 minutes. Drizzle with maple syrup, and serve warm.
