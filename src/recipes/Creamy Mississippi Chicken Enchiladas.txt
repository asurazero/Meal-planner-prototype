Creamy Mississippi Chicken Enchiladas


Ingredients
2 pounds boneless chicken breasts
1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch dressing mix
1 cup pepperoncini peppers
1/4 cup pepper juice
4 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup water
8 ounces cream cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
3 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
sliced green onions

Cooking Instructions

Place chicken, ranch dressing mix, pepperoncini, pepper
juice, butter, and water, in that order, into a slow cooker.
Cook on High for 2 hours or Low for 3 1/2 hours until
chicken easily shreds with a fork. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees F (1 degrees C). Remove half of the liquid in the
slow cooker and discard. Shred chicken in the remaining
liquid. Stir in cream cheese and sour cream. Place about 1/2
cup chicken mixture and 2 tablespoons cheese in each
tortilla and roll to seal. Place seam side down in a
9x13-inch casserole dish. Top with remaining cheese and pour
heavy cream evenly over the top. Bake in the preheated oven
until browned around the edges and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Top with green
onions and pico de gallo.
