Instant Ramen Carbonara


Ingredients
6 cups water
3 (3 ounce) packages instant ramen noodles
6 slices thick-cut bacon
2 large eggs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced

Cooking Instructions

Bring 6 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add
noodles and cook for 3 minutes. Drain and set aside. Heat a
large skillet over medium-high heat. Add bacon and cook
until crisp, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Using a
slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a plate lined with paper
towels. Whisk eggs, Parmesan, 2 tablespoons water, parsley,
and pepper in a mixing bowl. Set aside. Add garlic to the
skillet with bacon drippings and cook over medium-high heat
for 1 minute. Toss in drained noodles and cook 3 minutes
more. Turn off heat. Pour in reserved egg mixture, toss to
coat, and let sit 2 minutes before serving.
