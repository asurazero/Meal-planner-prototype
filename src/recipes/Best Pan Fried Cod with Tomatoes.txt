Best Pan Fried Cod with Tomatoes


Ingredients
1 pint grape tomatoes, halved
1 shallot, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon capers (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 1/2 pounds cod filets
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon chopped parsley for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Combine tomatoes, shallot, garlic, red wine vinegar, olive
oil, capers, and salt in a bowl, and set aside. About 15
minutes before cooking, remove cod from the refrigerator, so
it can come to room temperature. Cut cod into pieces,
thoroughly pat filets dry with a paper towel, and generously
season both sides with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet
over medium-high heat, add olive oil, melt butter, and swirl
to coat. Add cod, and do not move the pieces until it is
time to flip them over. Cook until fish flakes easily with a
fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63
degrees C). Carefully remove the filets from the skillet
with a spatula to a serving plate. Reduce the heat to medium
and In the same skillet, add the tomato mixture. Cook and
scrape up any bits stuck to the skillet bottom and stir
until the tomatoes just begin to soften, about 2 minutes.
Spoon tomato mixture over filets, garnish with parsley, and
serve.
