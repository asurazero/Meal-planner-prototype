Amish Friendship Bread Starter


Ingredients
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
Â¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
3 cups white sugar, divided
3 cups milk, divided

Cooking Instructions

Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl; let stand
until foamy, about 10 minutes. Combine 1 cup flour and 1 cup
sugar in a 2-quart container (glass, plastic, or ceramic);
mix thoroughly. Stir in 1 cup milk and yeast mixture. Cover
the container loosely and leave at room temperature until
bubbly. This is day 1 of the 10-day process. Days 2 through
4: Stir starter with a spoon. Day 5: Stir in 1 cup flour, 1
cup sugar, and 1 cup milk. Days 6 through 9: Stir starter
with a spoon. Day 10: Stir in remaining 1 cup flour, 1 cup
sugar, and 1 cup milk. Remove 1 cup starter to make your
first bread. Give 2 cups starter to friends (1 cup each)
along with this recipe and your favorite Amish bread recipe.
Store remaining 1 cup starter in a container in the
refrigerator or begin the 10-day process over again
(beginning with step 2).
