Grilled Halibut Foil Packs


Ingredients
2 (12x18 inch) pieces heavy duty aluminum foil
cooking spray
4 slices red onion
1 small zucchini
10 cherry tomatoes
1/2 cup corn kernels
4 to 6 thin slices garlic
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 (7 ounce) halibut filets
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning blend
2 tablespoons white wine
4 thin s lemon
4 to 6 sprigs fresh thyme

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an outdoor grill to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Spray each foil sheet with olive oil cooking spray. Layer 2
onion slices, 1/2 of the zucchini, 1/2 of the cherry
tomatoes, and 1/2 of the corn in the center of each of the
foil squares. Scatter 1/2 the garlic over each pack, and
season lightly with sea salt and freshly ground black
pepper. Pat halibut filets dry with paper towels, and add a
filet to each packet. Brush each filet with a thin layer of
mayonnaise, season lightly with sea salt and pepper, and
sprinkle with Italian seasoning. Drizzle 1 tablespoon dry
white wine over each packet. Place two slices of lemon on
top of each filet, and scatter thyme sprigs over the
contents of each packet. Bring edges of foil together, fold
edges over twice, and press tightly along the folds to seal.
Leave a bit of space inside the packet, to allow for steam.
Place packets directly on the preheated grill grates, close
the lid, and grill about 10 minutes per inch of the filet
thickness. Remove packs from the grill and allow to rest
about 5 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted into
the thickest part of fish should read 145 degrees F (63
degrees C). When ready to serve, place packs on serving
plates, and open carefully, because of the steam.
