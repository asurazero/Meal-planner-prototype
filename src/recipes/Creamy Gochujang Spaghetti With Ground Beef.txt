Creamy Gochujang Spaghetti With Ground Beef


Ingredients
12 ounces spaghetti
1 pound ground beef
1 bell pepper,
1/2 onion
2 garlic cloves
1/4 cup tomato paste
1/4 cup gochujang red chile paste
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook
spaghetti, stirring occasionally, until tender with a bite,
about 12 minutes. Scoop out 1/2 cup pasta water; set aside.
Drain spaghetti. Cook and stir ground beef, bell pepper, and
onion together in a large skillet, until meat and vegetables
are browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook until
fragrant, about 1 minute. Drain any excess grease and
discard. Add tomato paste and gochujang to meat, bring to a
simmer, and cook, stirring constantly, about 3 to 4 minutes.
Add heavy whipping cream, and cook and stir until fully
incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Add cooked
spaghetti to meat mixture; stir in Parmesan cheese. If sauce
is too thick, add reserved pasta water, 2 tablespoons at a
time, to thin to desired consistency.
