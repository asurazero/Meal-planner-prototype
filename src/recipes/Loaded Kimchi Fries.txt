Loaded Kimchi Fries


Ingredients
32 ounce frozen French fries
3 tablespoons canola oil
8 ounce mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup Cheez Whiz
1/4 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons Sriracha
1 cup cabbage kimchi
2 scallions,

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230
degrees C) with racks in top third and lower third
positions. Toss together fries and oil in a large bowl until
well coated. Spread fries in a single layer on prepared
baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown and
crisp, about 35 minutes, stirring fries and rotating pans
front to back and between top and bottom racks twice during
bake time. Consolidate fries onto one baking sheet,
arranging them into an even layer. Top fries evenly with
mozzarella balls. Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) in
top third of oven until cheese is slightly melted, 2 to 3
minutes. Meanwhile, place cheese dip in a small microwave-
safe medium bowl, and microwave on HIGH until warm and
melted, about 45 seconds, stirring after 30 seconds. Add
mayonnaise to cheese dip; stir until combined. Evenly
drizzle cheese dip mixture and hot sauce over french fry
mixture and top with kimchi and scallions. Divide between
plates and serve immediately.
