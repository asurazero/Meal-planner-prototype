Super Summer Grilled Bluefish


Ingredients
4 pounds bluefish fillets
1 cup orange juice
¼ cup fresh lime juice
¼ cup fresh lemon juice
¼ cup olive oil
1 tablespoon dry white wine
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
¼ cup citrus flavored seafood rub

Cooking Instructions

Place fish fillets into a large bowl. Pour in orange juice,
lime juice, lemon juice, olive oil, and white wine. Season
with salt, pepper, and seafood rub. Stir to blend and coat
fish. Leave squeezed lemon and lime halves in the bowl too.
Marinate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat a grill for high
heat. When the grill is hot, oil the grate. Place fish
fillets on the grill, and discard the marinade. Cook for 4
minutes on each side, or until fish flakes with a fork.
Transfer to a serving platter, and remove the dark blue part
of the fish before serving.
