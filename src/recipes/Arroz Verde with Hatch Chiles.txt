Arroz Verde with Hatch Chiles


Ingredients
2 green chiles
1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup long grain rice
1/2 cup onion
2 large garlic cloves
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon
2 teaspoons salt
1/8 teaspoon ground cumin

Cooking Instructions

Place Hatch chiles directly on the grates of a gas stove.
Cook over medium heat, flipping with tongs occasionally,
until blackened and charred, about 5 minutes. Place in a
sealed plastic bag and allow to cool, 7 to 8 minutes. Peel
off charred skins; remove seeds. Place chiles, chicken broth
and cilantro in the jar of a blender and blend until smooth.
Set aside. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until it
shimmers; add rice and onion. Cook and stir until lightly
browned, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until
fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken bouillon, salt,
and cumin. Add chile mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat to low; simmer until rice is tender, 25 to 30 minutes.
