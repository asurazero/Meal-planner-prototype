Chicken Fried Bacon


Ingredients
4 cups peanut oil
1 pound thick-cut bacon
1 tablespoon multi-purpose seasoning blend
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
2 large eggs
1/4 cup beer or water
2 teaspoons maple syrup
2 tablespoons ranch dressing

Cooking Instructions

Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and set a wire
rack inside. Heat oil in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven
over medium heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Meanwhile, cut bacon in half crosswise and season evenly on
both sides with multi-purpose seasoning. Whisk together
flour, salt, pepper, and paprika in a shallow bowl.
Alternatively, season flour with additional multi-purpose
seasoning blend. Whisk eggs, beer, and syrup together in a
separate shallow bowl. Coat each piece of bacon lightly in
seasoned flour. Then coat in egg mixture, allowing the
excess to drip off. Coat once more in flour mixture; set
aside until all pieces are coated and oil is hot. Working a
few pieces at a time, fry each piece in hot oil, flipping
occasionally, until crispy golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.
Maintain the oil temperature between 330 and 350 degrees F
(165 to 175 degrees C) while cooking. Drain bacon on the
prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining bacon. Serve with
ranch dressing for dipping.
