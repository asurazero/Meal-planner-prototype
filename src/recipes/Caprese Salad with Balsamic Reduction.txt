Caprese Salad with Balsamic Reduction


Ingredients
1 cup balsamic vinegar
¼ cup honey
3 large tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 (16 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/4-inch slices
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ cup fresh basil leaves
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Stir balsamic vinegar and honey
together in a small saucepan and place over high heat. Bring
to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until mixture has
reduced to 1/3 cup, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Arrange alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella
decoratively on a serving platter. Sprinkle with salt and
black pepper, tuck basil leaves around slices, and drizzle
with olive oil and the balsamic reduction.
