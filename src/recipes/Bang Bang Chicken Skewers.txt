Bang Bang Chicken Skewers


Ingredients
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup Thai sweet chili sauce
1 teaspoon riracha
1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken breast
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Cooking Instructions

For bang bang sauce, whisk mayonnaise, sweet chili sauce,
and Sriracha in a bowl until evenly combined. Set aside. In
a separate bowl add cubed chicken, oil, garlic powder,
paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir until evenly coated. Preheat
an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil the
grate. Thread chicken onto skewers; baste on all sides with
bang bang sauce. Place skewers directly on the grate. Grill
for 4 minutes. Turn skewers over, baste, and grill 4 minutes
more. Turn skewers over one last time, baste with remaining
sauce, and grill until chicken is no longer pink at the
center and juices run clear, about 2 minutes. An instant
read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165
degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the grill and serve
immediately.
