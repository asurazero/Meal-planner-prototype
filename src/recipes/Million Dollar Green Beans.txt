Million Dollar Green Beans


Ingredients
6 slices bacon, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup onion
3 cloves garlic
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 (10 ounce) packages green beans
crushed red pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Cook bacon in a very large skillet
over medium heat until crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Using a
slotted spoon or tongs, remove to a paper towel lined plate.
Drain bacon grease, reserving 1 tablespoon drippings in the
skillet. Add onion and garlic to the skillet. Cook over
medium heat until onion is tender, stirring often, about 2
minutes. Add brown sugar and soy sauce to the skillet. Cook
and stir over medium-low until mixture begins to thicken,
about 1 minute. Add beans to the skillet; cook until beans
are tender and sauce is glaze-like, about 5 minutes. Serve
beans topped with crispy bacon and crushed red pepper, if
desired.
