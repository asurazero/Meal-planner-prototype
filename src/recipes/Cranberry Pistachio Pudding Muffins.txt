Cranberry Pistachio Pudding Muffins


Ingredients
2 large eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
1/3 cup whole milk
2 cups all purpose flour
1 (3.4-ounce) package pistachio instant pudding mix
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2/3 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup chopped pistachios
1/4 cup turbinado (raw) sugar

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Let eggs, sour cream, and milk stand
at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425
degrees F (220 degrees C). Line twelve 2 1/2-inch muffin
cups with paper bake cups. Combine flour, pudding mix,
baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together
eggs, white sugar, and melted butter in a medium bowl until
combined. Add sour cream, milk, vanilla, and almond extract.
Whisk until combined. Stir in dried cranberries until
combined. Fold in flour mixture. Scoop batter into prepared
muffin cups. Sprinkle tops with pistachios and turbinado
sugar. This may seem like too much topping, but as the
cupcakes bake and expand, it will be the right amount. Bake
for 8 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (180
degrees C). Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers
comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool in muffin cups 5
minutes. Transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or cooled.
