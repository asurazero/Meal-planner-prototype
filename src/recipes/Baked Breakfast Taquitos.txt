Baked Breakfast Taquitos


Ingredients
4 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 cups cremini mushrooms
3/4 cup red bell pepper
1/3 cup onion
2 cups kale leaves
4 eggs
4 egg whites
1/2 cup Monterey Jack cheese with jalape√±os
1 ounce) green chiles
8 (6-inch) whole wheat flour tortillas
1/4 cup salsa
Mexican crema, chopped fresh cilantro, sliced green onions, and/or chopped black olives

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a
large nonstick skillet heat over medium heat. Add mushrooms,
bell pepper, and onion; cook until tender, stirring
occasionally, about 4 minutes. Add kale. Cook and stir until
wilted, about 1 minute. Remove from skillet. Add eggs and
egg whites to the hot skillet. Cook over medium heat,
without stirring, until mixture begins to set on the bottom
and around the edges. With a spatula, lift and fold the
partially cooked egg mixture so the uncooked portion flows
underneath. Continue cooking until egg mixture is cooked
through but still glossy and moist, 2 to 3 minutes. Return
vegetable mixture to skillet with cheese and chiles; stir
gently to combine. Fill each tortilla with about 1/3 cup
filling; roll up as tightly as possible. Arrange taquitos,
seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space
between each. Brush evenly with remaining 3 teaspoons oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until evenly browned and crispy,
about 15 minutes or. Serve with salsa and, if desired,
toppers.
