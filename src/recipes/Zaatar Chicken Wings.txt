Za’atar Chicken Wings


Ingredients
2 tablespoons dried thyme
1 1/2 teaspoons marjoram
1 tablespoon sumac
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 1/2 pounds whole chicken wings
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 large egg white
2 tablespoons honey
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped parsley (optional)
2 teaspoons sumac,

Cooking Instructions

For za'atar, grind thyme with a mortar and pestle, or using
a spice grinder. Add marjoram and grind fine; place thyme
and marjoram in a small bowl. Add sumac, sesame seeds,
cumin, black pepper, and cayenne, and stir thoroughly. Store
in an airtight container until needed. For wings, cut whole
wings into flat and drum sections, and add to a bowl. Add
salt and garlic powder, and mix thoroughly. Cover;
refrigerate for at least 2 or up to 24 hours. Preheat the
oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with
parchment. Whisk egg white, honey, and lemon juice together
in a small bowl until foamy. Pour over wings and stir
thoroughly. Add zaâ€™atar, and toss until evenly coated.
Arrange wings, evenly spaced, on the prepared pan. Bake in
the preheated oven until bottoms of wings start to brown,
about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven; turn wings over.
Continue baking until wings are well browned, and meat
easily pulls off the bone, 20 to 30 minutes more. Rest wings
for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Place on a serving tray,
drizzle with olive oil, and top with parsley. Sprinkle with
additional sumac or zaâ€™atar if desired. For a sweeter,
stickier version, drizzle with a little more honey.
