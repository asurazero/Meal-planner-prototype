Ingredients
20 Nutter Butter sandwich cookies
5 tablespoons butter, melted
2 (8-ounce packages) cream cheese, softened
1 ( 8-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 cups heavy whipping cream, divided
1 3.4 ounce) package vanilla instant pudding mix
1/2 ( 3.4 ounce) package banana instant pudding mix
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 bananas, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons peanut butter, plus more for topping

Cooking Instructions

Pulse cookies in a food processor until finely crushed. Add
melted butter and pulse just until combined. Press mixture
into the bottom of a 9 inch spring form pan. Freeze crust
while filling is prepared. In a stand mixer fitted with a
paddle attachment, beat cream cheese until light and fluffy.
Add in sweetened condensed milk and 1 1/2 cups cream and
beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as
necessary. Add in pudding mixes, vanilla, and salt and blend
until smooth and well combined. Mixture will be very thick.
Spread half of the pudding mixture into the pan over the
crust. Add banana slices in an even layer over pudding
mixture. Melt peanut butter for about 15 seconds in the
microwave and drizzle evenly over the banana slices. Top
with remaining pudding mixture and spread into an even
layer. Refrigerate for 2 hours and up to overnight. Whip
remaining cream and powdered sugar together until soft peaks
form. Serve cheesecake topped with whipped cream. Top with
half of a cookie and more melted peanut butter if desired.
