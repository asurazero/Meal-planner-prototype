Cornmeal Cookies


Ingredients
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3/4 cup light brown sugar
2 tablespoons honey
1 large egg yolk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon cornmeal

Cooking Instructions

Beat butter, brown sugar, and honey together on medium-high
speed with an electric mixer for 5 minutes. Add in egg yolk,
vanilla, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg and mix for 1 minute.
Add in flour, 3/4 cup cornmeal, baking powder, and baking
soda and mix until just combined. Mix 2 tablespoons white
sugar and 1 tablespoon corn meal together in a small bowl.
Scoop out 2 tablespoons of the dough and roll into a ball.
Roll dough ball into the sugar-corn meal mixture until
thoroughly coated. Repeat with remaining cookie dough. Chill
dough balls in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Preheat the
oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets
with parchment paper. Place dough balls 2 inches apart on
the prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven, one
pan at a time, until cookies are crackled and begin to turn
very light golden brown, 14 to 16 minutes. Cool cookies on
baking sheets for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack
to cool completely.
