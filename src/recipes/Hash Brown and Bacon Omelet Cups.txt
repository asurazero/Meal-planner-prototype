Hash Brown and Bacon Omelet Cups


Ingredients
cooking spray
3 cups frozen shredded hash brown potatoes, thawed
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups shredded Mexican-style four-cheese blend
6 large eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 cup red bell pepper
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper (optional)
6 slices
chopped fresh chives, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12
(2 1/2-inch) muffin cups with cooking spray. Wrap hash
browns in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze to remove as
much moisture as possible. Stir together hash browns, melted
butter, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Press about
1/4 cup of the hash brown mixture into bottom and up the
sides of each prepared muffin cup. Bake in the preheated
oven until lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
stir together cheese, eggs, bell pepper, and crushed red
pepper (if using) in a bowl. Remove muffin tin from the
oven. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees
C). Top hash browns with half of the bacon. Top with egg
mixture and remaining bacon. Bake until a knife inserted
into centers comes out clean, 13 to 15 minutes. Garnish with
chives.
