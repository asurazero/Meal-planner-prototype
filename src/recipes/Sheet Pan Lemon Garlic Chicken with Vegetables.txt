Sheet Pan Lemon Garlic Chicken with Vegetables


Ingredients
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup red onion
4 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons seasoning
1 pound asparagus
6 mini bell peppers
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 lemon, zested and juiced
lemon slices, for garnish (optional)
fresh parsley sprigs, for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and line a
sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Pat chicken thighs
dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Melt
butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When butter
is sizzling, add chicken and cook until browned, 3 to 5
minutes per side. Place chicken on the prepared sheet pan.
Roast chicken in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. To the
same skillet, off the heat, add onion, garlic, and Greek
seasoning. Stir, warming in the skillet off the heat, but
not cooking. Stir in asparagus and bell peppers. Combine
chicken broth, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a small bowl.
Stir into the skillet with the vegetables, and allow to sit
off the heat. Turn chicken thighs over, and add just the
vegetables to the sheet pan around the chicken. Ladle about
2 tablespoons of the pan liquid over each chicken thigh.
Return to the oven and bake until chicken is no longer pink
at the center, juices run clear, and an instant read
thermometer inserted near the center of chicken reads 165
degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes more. Place
chicken pieces in the center of a serving dish and surround
with vegetables. Garnish with lemon slices and fresh parsley
sprigs. Serve warm.
