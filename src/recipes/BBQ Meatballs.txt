BBQ Meatballs


Ingredients
1 pound ground beef, 20% fat or higher preferred
1 large egg
1/2 cup tortilla chips
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons BBQ sauce, or as needed, for basting

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment. Add ground beef, egg, tortilla
chips, ketchup, brown sugar, smoked paprika, garlic powder,
onion powder, cayenne, oregano, salt, and black pepper to a
large bowl. Mix together gently with your hands until evenly
combined. Roll mixture into balls, about the size of a golf
ball. Place meatballs on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in
the preheated oven for 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and
baste with BBQ sauce. Return to the oven and bake about 12
more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Serve as desired.
