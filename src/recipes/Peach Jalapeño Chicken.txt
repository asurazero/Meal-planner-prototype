1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon chili powder

Cooking Instructions

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until
hot, about 2 minutes. Season chicken with salt, pepper,
smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and chili
powder. Add chicken breast to the hot skillet; cook chicken
until no longer pink at the center and juices run clear,
about 5 minutes. Remove chicken to a bowl; set aside. Add
peaches and jalapeÃ±o to the same skillet; cook until peaches
soften, 5 to 6 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together
peach preserves, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, and
cornstarch until well combined. Set aside. Return cooked
chicken to the skillet and stir in peach preserves mixture,
making sure to coat chicken and peaches well. Continue to
cook, stirring, until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes.
Garnish with fresh or dried cilantro when serving.
