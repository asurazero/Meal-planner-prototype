One Pan Chicken Breast and Asparagus in Lemon Cream Sauce


Ingredients
1 lemon,
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 2)
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup shallots
1 pound asparagus,
1 tablespoon fresh basil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/3 cup heavy cream
basil
lemon slices for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Combine lemon zest and juice, minced garlic, red pepper
flakes, and chicken broth in a small bowl and set aside.
Slice each chicken breast in half horizontally to create 4
cutlets. Pat dry with paper towels and lightly season with
salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over
medium heat. When the oil shimmers, carefully add chicken
pieces and brown for 3 to 5 minutes per side. Chicken will
not be fully cooked. Remove to a plate and keep warm. To the
same skillet, add shallots and cook until softened, about 2
minutes. Add chicken broth mixture and bring to a boil.
Return chicken to the skillet with any accumulated juices.
Add asparagus pieces around chicken and sprinkle on minced
basil. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to simmer
until asparagus is tender, and chicken is no longer pink at
the center and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove
cover and increase heat to medium. Melt butter, one
tablespoon at a time, stirring continuously, allowing sauce
to thicken a little. Remove from heat and stir in cream. To
serve, place in a serving dish and garnish with additional
fresh basil and lemon slices.
