Mochi Muffins


Ingredients
2 cups glutinous sweet rice flour (such as Mochiko)
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 (14-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
2 large eggs
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
1 teaspoon sesame seeds

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Line twelve 2 1/2-inch muffin cups with
paper bake cups or grease cups generously. Whisk together
rice flour, sugars, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Whisk
together coconut milk, eggs, butter, vanilla, and maple
syrup in a large bowl. Add flour mixture to coconut milk
mixture and stir just until combined. Divide batter between
prepared muffin cups, filling nearly full. Sprinkle with
sesame seeds. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick
inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
Cool in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. Remove from pan and
serve warm or cool completely.
