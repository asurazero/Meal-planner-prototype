Texas Toast “Maid Rites”


Ingredients
1 pound ground round
1 cup yellow onion
2 teaspoons garlic
1/4 cup beef broth
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon light brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 slices Texas Toast garlic bread
8 ounces triple Cheddar blend
bread and butter pickle chips

Cooking Instructions

Gather ingredients. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220
degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add
ground beef and onion; cook, stirring often to crumble,
until meat is browned in spots and no longer pink, and onion
is softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring
constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. While meat
cooks, whisk together broth, vinegar, brown sugar,
worcestershire, salt, soy sauce, yellow mustard, and pepper
in a small bowl. Stir broth mixture into skillet and cook,
stirring often, until sauce has reduced slightly, about 2
minutes. Remove from heat. Arrange toasts in an even layer
on a large rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven
until crisp and lightly browned on the bottoms, but still
soft in the center, 8 to 9 minutes. Use the round side of a
large spoon to press into the center of each toast to create
a well, leaving about a 1/4-inch border around the edge of
each bread. Spoon about a heaping 1/4 cup of meat mixture
into each well. Sprinkle meat and toasts with cheese (about
1/4 cup per toast). Return baking sheet to oven and bake at
425 degrees F (220 degrees C) until cheese is just melted
and toasts are crisp, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately
with pickle chips.
