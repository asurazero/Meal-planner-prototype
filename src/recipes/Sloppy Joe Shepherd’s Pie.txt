1 teaspoon dry mustard

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
(190 degrees C). Heat oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet
over medium-high. Add garlic; cook, stirring constantly,
until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ground chuck; cook,
stirring to crumble beef into small pieces, until browned,
about 6 minutes. Remove from heat, spoon drippings into a
small bowl. Let drippings cool, then discard. Add onion to
skillet; cook over medium, stirring often, until onions have
softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in bouillon, sugar, mustard,
and pepper until well combined. Stir in crushed tomatoes,
ketchup, broth, tomato paste, and Worcestershire sauce until
well combined. Bring to a simmer over medium-high; cook,
stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and
glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Spoon mashed
potatoes over beef mixture in skillet and gently spread into
an even layer to cover beef completely. Sprinkle evenly with
cheeses. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are
heated through and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
Increase oven temperature to broil; do not remove skillet.
Broil until cheese is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Let
stand 5 minutes; garnish with chives, and serve.
