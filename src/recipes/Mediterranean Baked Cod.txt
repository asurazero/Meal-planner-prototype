Mediterranean Baked Cod


Ingredients
cooking spray
1 1/2 pounds cod filets
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons seasoning
1/3 cup pitted Kalamata olives
1/3 cup artichoke hearts in brine
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil
2 teaspoons lemon juice
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, or as needed
4 lemon wedges

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees F). Line a
baking sheet with aluminum foil, and spray with cooking
spray. Pat fish filets dry with a paper towel. Place cod on
the baking sheet, lightly coat the tops with olive oil, and
sprinkle with Greek seasoning. In a small bowl, combine
Kalamata olives, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, lemon
juice, and garlic. Evenly spoon the mixture over the filets.
Bake until cod flakes easily with a fork, 14 to 16 minutes.
The internal temperature, measured with an instant-read
thermometer, should reach 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Baking time may vary slightly depending on the thickness of
filets. Carefully remove cod and topping to a serving dish
using a large spatula. Garnish with chopped parsley, and
serve immediately with a wedge of lemon.
