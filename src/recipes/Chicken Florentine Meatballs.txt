Chicken Florentine Meatballs


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup white onion
3 cloves garlic,
4 ounces fresh spinach, chopped
1 pound ground chicken
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon talian seasoning
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 tablespoons butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white wine
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 ounces fresh spinach
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch baking sheet with
parchment paper. For meatballs, heat oil in a large skillet
over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic until tender, about
3 minutes. Add chopped spinach and cook until just wilted,
about 2 minutes. Set aside to cool. Combine ground chicken,
panko, cornstarch, Italian seasoning, salt, and crushed red
pepper in a large bowl. Gently stir in cooled onion mixture.
Shape mixture into about 20 meatballs using about 1 1/2
tablespoons per meatball. Place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake until an instant read thermometer inserted in the
center of meatballs reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 20
to 25 minutes. Meanwhile for sauce, heat butter in the same
skillet. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add flour and cook 1 additional minute. Add wine and chicken
broth. Simmer and stir until thickened and bubbly, 1 to 2
minutes. Stir in cream and Parmesan cheese. Cook until
slightly thickened, 2 minutes. Add spinach and cook until
just wilted, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Add meatballs to skillet, stir to coat in sauce. Return to a
simmer, about 1 minute. Serve warm.
