French Onion Chicken Casserole


Ingredients
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups yellow onion
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup carrot
1 tablespoon garlic
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (10.5 ounce) can French onion soup
1/4 cup white wine
1 cup sour cream
1 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 cups Gruyere cheese, shredded, divided
6 cups chopped rotisserie chicken (
1 (5 ounce) package croutons

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Melt butter in a large skillet over medium
heat. Add onion, celery, carrot, garlic, thyme, salt, and
pepper; cook, stirring often, until onions are softened and
translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add French onion soup and wine,
and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer, undisturbed,
until reduced and slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir
in sour cream, mayonnaise, and mustard, and return to a
simmer. Add 1 cup Gruyère, and cook, stirring constantly,
until completely melted and combined, about 1 minute. Remove
from heat, and fold in chicken. Transfer to a 9x13-inch
baking dish. Sprinkle croutons evenly over chicken mixture;
sprinkle evenly with remaining Gruyère cheese. Bake in the
preheated oven until bubbling and cheese is melted, 12 to 15
minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with
additional thyme and pepper.
