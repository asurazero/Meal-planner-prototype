Creamy Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Pasta


Ingredients
8 ounces fettuccine
1 pound boneless chicken breast,
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup sun dried tomatoes
2 large cloves garlic
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup fresh basil,
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Cooking Instructions

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a
rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet
firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and keep warm.
Meanwhile, season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2
teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet. Add chicken to
skillet, cook and stir for 3 minutes. Add sun-dried tomatoes
and garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 1 more minute.
Add cream, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and 2
tablespoons basil. Cook on low, stirring constantly, until
cheese is melted. Stir red pepper flakes and fettuccine into
sauce. Season with remaining salt and pepper. Top with
remaining basil.
