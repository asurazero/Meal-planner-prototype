Easy One Pan Ramen Chicken Alfredo


Ingredients
6 (3 ounce) package chicken flavored ramen noodles
2 (15 ounce) jars Alfredo sauce
3 cups shredded cooked chicken
1 cup water
1 cup heavy cream
2 cups cheese
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange
uncooked ramen noodles in an even layer in the bottom of a
large casserole dish, breaking noodle blocks as necessary to
fit. Sprinkle 1 packet of seasoning evenly over noodles;
discard remaining seasoning packets. Pour 1 jar of Alfredo
sauce evenly over noodles. Spread chicken evenly over sauce.
Pour second jar of Alfredo sauce over chicken. Add water to
first Alfredo jar, shake it to rinse sauce from the jar, and
pour mixture over noodles. Add cream to second jar, shake,
and pour over the casserole. Top with cheese and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbly and
noodles are tender, 50 to 60 minutes. Add up to 1/2 cup more
water as needed, if too much is absorbed before noodles are
cooked.
