Creamy Chicken Sausage Orzo Skillet


Ingredients
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil or avocado oil
4 chicken sausages,
2 teaspoons garlic paste
4 ounces orzo pasta
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon red chili flakes
4 large basil leaves, shredded
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Heat a heavy bottom pot over medium-low heat and drizzle in
oil. Fry chicken sausage rounds until browned and cooked
through, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.
Add orzo and cook and stir until lightly golden brown, about
1 minute. Pour in chicken broth and 1/2 cup cream. Stir in
salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and chili flakes.
Bring mixture to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to a
simmer. Simmer until orzo is very tender, about 10 minutes.
Check occasionally; add additional cream as needed if orzo
becomes too dry before it is tender. Lower heat to low, then
stir in basil and Parmesan until fully incorporated. Serve
and enjoy!
