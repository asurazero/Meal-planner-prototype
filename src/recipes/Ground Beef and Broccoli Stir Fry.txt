Ground Beef and Broccoli Stir Fry


Ingredients
1 cup beef broth
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons light brown sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon fresh ginger
2 teaspoons garlic
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
3 tablespoons canola oil
2 cups yellow onion
2 (8 ounce) packages broccoli florets
1 pound ground beef
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 cups cooked jasmine or sticky rice,
scallions

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Whisk together beef broth, soy
sauce, brown sugar, cornstarch, ginger, garlic, and rice
vinegar in a bowl until combined and sugar and cornstarch
are dissolved; set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a
large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add
onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened,
about 2 minutes. Add broccoli, and cook, stirring
occasionally, until bright green, tender-crisp, and onion is
browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Do not wipe
skillet clean. Reduce the heat to medium, and add remaining
1 tablespoon oil to skillet. Add ground beef and salt, and
cook, stirring often to break meat into even crumbles, until
browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Whisk broth
mixture again, and pour into skillet. Cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly, until sauce thickens slightly, 3 to 5
minutes. Return broccoli mixture to skillet, and cook,
stirring occasionally, until sauce evenly coats meat and
vegetables, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve over rice, and garnish
with scallions and toasted sesame seeds.
