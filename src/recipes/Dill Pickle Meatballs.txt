Dill Pickle Meatballs


Ingredients
cooking Spray
1 pound 80/20 ground beef
3/4 cup round buttery cracker
1/3 cup yellow onion
1 large egg
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
4 ounces feta cheese
1/4 cup finely chopped dill pickles
3/4 cup chopped fresh mixed herbs
1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup plain whole milk yogurt
2 cups buttered rice,

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Generously spray a large rimmed
baking sheet with cooking spray. Add beef, cracker crumbs,
onion, egg, garlic powder, black pepper, 1/2 cup feta,
chopped dill pickles, 4 tablespoons pickle juice, 1/2 cup
herbs, and 1 teaspoon salt to a large bowl; stir gently
using a fork or clean hands until just combined, being sure
not to overwork meat. Cover and chill in the refrigerator
for at least 15 minutes or up to 12 hours. The meatballs are
easiest to form when cold. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C) with rack in top third position. Roll beef
mixture into 24 (about 1 1/4 ounce; 1 tablespoon plus 2
teaspoons) meatballs. Arrange meatballs on the prepared
baking sheet evenly spaced apart. Bake in the preheated oven
for 10 minutes. Increase oven temperature to broil, do not
remove meatballs from oven. Broil until tops are browned and
meatballs are cooked through, about 6 minutes. While
meatballs bake, whisk together yogurt, remaining 1
tablespoon pickle juice, remaining 1/4 cup herbs, and
remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl until combined.
Divide buttered rice among 4 plates. Top evenly with
meatballs and remaining 1/2 cup feta cheese. Serve with
yogurt sauce and garnish with pepper and herbs.
