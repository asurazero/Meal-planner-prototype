Skillet Garlic Knot Chicken


Ingredients
4 chicken breast cutlets
1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
6 large garlic cloves
2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley,
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
lemon wedges

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Pat chicken dry with paper towels
and season chicken all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2
teaspoon pepper; set aside. Heat oil and 2 tablespoons of
the butter in a large skillet over medium-high. Add chicken
in an even layer, in batches if necessary; cook, turning
once halfway through, until browned and a thermometer
inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 165
degrees F (74 degrees C), 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove
chicken from skillet, using tongs, and set on plate; set
aside. Do not wipe skillet clean. With skillet off the heat,
add remaining 4 tablespoons butter and stir until melted,
about 1 minute. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30
seconds. Return skillet to medium, and add chicken in an
even layer with any accumulated juices. Add parsley and
remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper; cook, turning
chicken occasionally, until chicken is heated through, about
1 minute. Remove from heat. Sprinkle evenly with Parmesan
cheese and garnish with additional parsley. Serve
immediately with lemon wedges.
