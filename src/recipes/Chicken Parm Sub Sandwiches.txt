Chicken Parm Sub Sandwiches


Ingredients
cooking spray
4 frozen breaded chicken breast fillets
Â½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 (16 ounce) package frozen garlic bread, thawed
1 cup tomato sauce or marinara sauce
4 slices provolone cheese
12 fresh basil leaves, or to taste
aluminum foil

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a
baking pan with vegetable oil spray. Place frozen chicken
fillets on the prepared pan and bake in the preheated oven
for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn chicken, sprinkle 2 tablespoons
Parmesan cheese on each fillet, and bake until crispy, an
additional 10 to 12 minutes. Slice garlic bread into 4 equal
portions. Open each portion and place garlic-side up on a
baking sheet. Warm garlic bread in the oven about 5 minutes.
To assemble the sandwiches, place a chicken fillet on a
piece of garlic bread, spoon 1/4 cup tomato sauce or
marinara sauce on top of the chicken, and lay a slice of
provolone cheese on top of the sauce. Place 3 basil leaves,
or more to taste, on each sandwich, and top with the other
half. Wrap each sandwich in foil and return to the oven
until the cheese is melted, 5 to 8 minutes. Unwrap and serve
warm.
