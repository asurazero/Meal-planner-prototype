One Pan Pasta with Bacon and Peas


Ingredients
8 ounces bacon
1/2 cup onion
2 cloves garlic
2 2/3 cups chicken broth
2/3 cup milk
8 ounces rotini pasta
1 cup frozen peas
3/4 cup plain Greek yogurt
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy,
about 3 minutes. Transfer bacon to a plate lined with a
paper towel. Remove all but about 2 tablespoons bacon grease
from the skillet. Add onion to the skillet, and cook until
translucent and tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook
until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in chicken broth and
milk, and bring to a boil. Stir in pasta, reduce heat to
medium low, cover the skillet, and cook, stirring
occasionally, until pasta is al dente, 13 to 15 minutes.
Stir in peas, and cook just until thawed. Add Greek yogurt
and bacon, stir to combine, and season with salt and pepper.
Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve.
