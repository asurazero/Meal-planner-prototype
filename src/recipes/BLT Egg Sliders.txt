BLT Egg Sliders


Ingredients
8 slices bacon
12 extra large hard boiled eggs
2 teaspoons mayonnaise
2 Roma tomatoes
12 leaves Bibb lettuce
3/4 teaspoon seasoned salt

Cooking Instructions

Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10
minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Break bacon
slices into thirds when cool enough to handle. Slice eggs in
half lengthwise. Place 12 egg halves on a serving plate. Set
other egg halves aside. Spread mayonnaise on 12 egg halves.
Top each with 2 pieces of bacon. Top each with 1 tomato
slice and 1 folded lettuce leaf. Top each with a reserved
egg half. Secure each "slider" with a toothpick. Sprinkle
with seasoned salt and serve.
