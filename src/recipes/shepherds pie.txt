shepherds pie


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly
grease a medium baking dish. Place beef and onion in a large
skillet over medium heat. Season with rosemary and basil.
Cook and stir until beef is evenly browned; drain grease.
Mix in mixed vegetables, diced tomatoes, and tomato sauce.
Cook and stir until vegetables are heated through. Transfer
to the prepared baking dish. Place potatoes in a large pot
with enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Cook until
tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain. Add
butter, Romano cheese, milk, garlic, salt, and oregano to
potatoes in the pot. Mash together with a potato masher
until smooth. Spread mashed potatoes over beef and vegetable
mixture in the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for
30 minutes. Turn the oven broiler to high and continue
cooking until the top of potatoes are golden brown, about 3
minutes.
