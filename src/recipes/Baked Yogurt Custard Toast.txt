Baked Yogurt Custard Toast


Ingredients
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 slices French bread
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 large egg
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup blueberries
1 cup strawberries
1/3 cup maple syrup
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment. Butter one
side of bread, and place butter-side-down on the prepared
baking sheet. Whisk together yogurt, honey, vanilla extract,
lemon zest, egg, and salt in a mixing bowl. Spoon custard
mixture over bread, all the way to the edges, and pressing
down lightly as you apply, to help the bread absorb as much
as possible. Try to use all the custard. Bake in the
preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir blueberries, strawberries, maple syrup, and
lemon juice together in a bowl; set aside until needed.
Serve custard toast immediately topped with fresh fruit.
