Ruthie’s Scandinavian Christmas Cookies


Ingredients
1 cup unsalted butter
2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup chopped pecans
3 1/4 teaspoons water
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine butter, pastry flour, 1 cup confectioners' sugar,
pecans, water, and vanilla extract in a bowl; mix until well
combined. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)
and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll dough
into 1 tablespoon-size balls and set on the prepared baking
sheet. Working in batches, bake in the preheated oven until
bottoms are light golden brown but tops are still pale,
about 14 minutes. Let cookies cool completely. Dust or roll
them in confectionerâ€™s sugar.
