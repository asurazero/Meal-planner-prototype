Chicken Koftas


Ingredients
1 cup chopped sweet onion
1 cup cilantro leaves and tender stems
1/2 cup mint leaves
4 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons fresh ginger
1 jalapeño chile
1 pound ground chicken
1/4 cup dry breadcrumbs or cornmeal
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large egg
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
cooking spray

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Add onion, cilantro, mint, garlic,
ginger, and jalapeño to a food processor; pulse until very
finely chopped, about 10 (1-second) pulses. Transfer mixture
to a kitchen towel, and squeeze out as much liquid as
possible. Add squeezed onion mixture, ground chicken,
breadcrumbs, oil, egg, garlic powder, salt, cumin,
coriander, and black pepper to a large bowl; mix gently
until thoroughly incorporated. With moistened gloved hands,
shape chicken mixture into 12 (3x1-1/2-inch) cylinders and
place on a baking sheet. (If grilling, shape mixture onto
skewers). To Broil: Preheat the oven’s broiler and set a
rack about 7 inches from the heat source. Line a large
rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil, and coat with
cooking spray. Arrange koftas in a single layer about 2
inches apart, and spray with cooking spray. Broil, flipping
koftas halfway through cook time, until browned and a
thermometer inserted into center reads 165 degrees F (74
degrees C), about 8 minutes. To Grill: Preheat grill to
medium, 350 to 400 degrees F (175 to 200 degrees C). Place
skewers on oiled grates; grill, covered, flipping every 2
minutes, until charred and a thermometer inserted into
center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 8 minutes.
Alternative Method: Heat a large oiled grill pan over
medium-high, about 2 minutes. Add koftas to pan; grill,
uncovered, flipping every 2 minutes, until charred and a
thermometer inserted into center reads 165 degrees F (74
degrees C), about 10 minutes. To Air-fry: Preheat an air
fryer to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C) for 2 minutes. Spray
koftas with cooking spray. Working in batches if needed, add
koftas to air fryer basket in a single layer, and cook,
flipping after 4 minutes, until browned and a thermometer
inserted into center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C),
about 8 minutes.
