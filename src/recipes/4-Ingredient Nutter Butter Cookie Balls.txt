4-Ingredient Nutter Butter Cookie Balls


Ingredients
16 ounces peanut butter sandwich cookies (such as Nutter Butter®)
½ (16 ounce) jar peanut butter (such as Jif®)
½ (24 ounce) package chocolate candy melts
¼ cup multicolored candy sprinkles

Cooking Instructions

Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
Crush peanut butter cookies in a food processor until they
are crumbs. Pour into the bowl of a stand mixer and add
peanut butter. Mix on medium speed until a dough forms,
about 5 minutes. Scoop dough and form 20 balls, placing them
onto the prepared baking sheet. Freeze for 30 minutes so
they will hold together while dipping. Melt chocolate candy
in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave, stirring
frequently, in 30-second increments. Insert a toothpick into
each cookie ball and dip into melted chocolate. Return balls
to the prepared baking sheet and top with sprinkles.
