Chicken Teriyaki


Ingredients
1 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup sake
3 tablespoons rice vinegar
1/3 cup brown sugar, or more to taste
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 teaspoons canola or peanut oil
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
2 teaspoons fresh ginger
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced, divided
1 1/2 cups cooked rice

Cooking Instructions

Combine soy sauce, sake, rice vinegar, and brown sugar in a
bowl and whisk well until sugar is dissolved. Stir in sesame
seeds and crushed red pepper and set aside. Heat oils in a
large skillet over high heat. Sprinkle salt and pepper
evenly over chicken. Add chicken in a single layer to the
skillet and cook, undisturbed until chicken is browned and
releases easily from the pan, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken
pieces, cook 1 more minute and remove from pan; set aside.
Reduce heat to medium and add ginger and garlic. Cook,
stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reserve
2 tablespoon of the green onions for garnish and add
remaining green onions to the skillet. Cook for 1 minute.
Add 1 cup reserved soy sauce mixture to the skillet and stir
with a wooden spoon, scraping up any browned bits from the
bottom of the skillet. Bring mixture to a boil and cook
until sauce has reduced by about a third or until slightly
thickened and glossy. Return chicken to the skillet and
cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened
slightly and chicken is coated in the sauce and cooked
through. Serve over rice and sprinkled with reserved green
onions.
