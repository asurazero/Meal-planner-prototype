Duchess Potato Casserole


Ingredients
4 pounds Yukon gold potatoe
3 1/2 teaspoons salt
9 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 (5.3-ounce) package boursin garlic & fine herbs cheese
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup chives
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
6 large egg yolks

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Place potatoes in a large pot and
cover with cold water to a depth of 2 inches; add 2
teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat,
reduce heat to medium and simmer potatoes until they are
tender and easily mashed with a fork, about 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Drain and
return potatoes to the pot. Cook over medium, stirring
constantly, for 2 minutes to help dry potatoes. Mash
potatoes and 8 tablespoons butter until mostly smooth. (Some
small pieces of potato are OK.) Add boursin, cream, chives,
pepper, nutmeg, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt; mash
until well combined, stopping to scrape down sides as
needed. Add in egg yolks, 1 at a time, stirring between each
addition until incorporated. Spread potato mixture evenly in
a 2- to 2 1/4-quart baking dish. Gently brush top of potato
mixture with remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Score top as
desired using the tines of a fork; wipe fork clean as
needed. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown,
slightly puffed, and an instant read thermometer inserted in
center registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), about 30
minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with
chives and pepper.
