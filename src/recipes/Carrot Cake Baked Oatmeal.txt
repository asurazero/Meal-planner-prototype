Carrot Cake Baked Oatmeal


Ingredients
2 1/3 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup walnuts
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup maple syrup
1 3/4 cups half-and-half
1 large egg
2 tablespoons unsalted butte
2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste
2 carrots
1 cup golden raisins

Cooking Instructions

Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
(190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick
spray. Set aside. Stir oats, 1/4 cup walnuts, cinnamon,
baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and salt together in a
bowl. Whisk maple syrup, half-and-half, egg, butter, and
vanilla bean paste together in another bowl; stir into oat
mixture. Place carrots in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave
on High for 45 seconds. Stir carrots and raisins into oat
mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle
remaining nuts on top. Bake in the preheated oven until the
top is nicely golden and a toothpick inserted near the
center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from the
oven to cool completely. Cut into squares to serve.
