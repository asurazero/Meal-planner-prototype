Green Goddess Chicken and Cucumber Wraps


Ingredients
2 (7 inch) spinach herb tortillas
2 leaf lettuce leaves
2 (1 ounce) slices mozzarella
2/3 cup cooked chicken breast
1 cucumber
1/2 avocado
1 thin slice sweet onion
2 tablespoons green goddess salad dressing,
2 green onion leaves
grape tomatoes

Cooking Instructions

For each wrap, place a tortilla on a flat work surface and
cover half the tortilla surface with a piece of leaf
lettuce. Top lettuce with 1 mozzarella slice, and distribute
1/3 cup shredded chicken over cheese. Cut cucumber in half
crosswise. Cut one half into 6 to 8 cucumber spears, and set
aside. Use a vegetable peeler to shave remaining half of
cucumber into very thin pieces, avoiding seeds. Place 1/2 of
shaved cucumber on top of chicken. Add half the avocado
slices and half the sweet onion rings. Drizzle with 1
tablespoon green goddess dressing. Begin rolling the
tortilla from the filled edge to the unfilled edge. Roll
wrap in a paper towel to mold. Meanwhile, repeat steps with
remaining ingredients for second wrap. Release first wrap
from paper towel and tie closed with a green onion leaf or
chive. Release and tie second wrap. To serve, place wraps on
a bed of leaf lettuce. Lettuce leaves may be used for an
optional outer wrap. Garnish with reserved cucumber spears
and grape tomatoes.
