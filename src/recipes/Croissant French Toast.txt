Croissant French Toast


Ingredients
4 large croissants, halved horizontally, left out overnight
3 large eggs
½ cup half-and-half
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons unsalted butter

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Whisk
eggs, half-and-half, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and
nutmeg together in a shallow bowl. Dip each croissant half
into egg mixture, one at a time, flipping it and lightly
pressing down, until well coated. Melt butter in a large
skillet over medium heat; add four croissant halves, cut-
side down. Fry until browned on both sides, turning once, 2
to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven to keep warm
while you cook the remaining croissants. Serve warm with
your favorite toppings.
