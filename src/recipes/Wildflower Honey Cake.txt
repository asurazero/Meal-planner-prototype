Wildflower Honey Cake


Ingredients
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup unsalted butter
2/3 cup honey
3 tablespoons plain yogurt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 large eggs
1/3 cup sliced almonds
1/3 cup honey
3 tablespoons water

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a
9-inch round cake pan, and line the base with a circle of
parchment. Whisk flour, baking powder, and kosher salt
together in a bowl; set aside. Beat butter and honey
together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and
fluffy. Add yogurt, vanilla, 2 eggs, and about 1/3 of flour
mixture. Mix until everything is incorporated. Add the
remaining 2 eggs and flour; mix just until flour disappears.
Use a spatula to spread batter into the prepared pan. Smooth
top and apply almonds to the surface. Bake in the preheated
oven until a toothpick comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
Cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make syrup: Toast
honey in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it turns a
light brown, and takes on a caramelized honey aroma. Turn
off heat and add water. Swirl the pan to stir in the water,
and let cool until needed. Invert cake onto a plate, and
soak the top evenly with toasted honey syrup. Cool cake
completely before serving.
