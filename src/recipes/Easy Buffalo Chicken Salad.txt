Easy Buffalo Chicken Salad


Ingredients
2 boneless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
1/4 cup grapeseed oil
1/3 cup ranch dressing
1/3 cup hot sauce
8 cups lettuce
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1/2 cucumber, sliced
1/2 cup shredded carrots
1/2 cup blue cheese
salad dressing

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a
baking sheet. Season chicken with 1 tablespoon Cajun
seasoning. Heat oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high
heat. Add chicken to the hot oil, without crowding, and
cook, turning once, until no longer pink at the center and
juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read
thermometer inserted near the center will read 165 degrees F
(74 degrees C). Remove chicken from pan to a plate to cool,
about 10 minutes. Stir ranch dressing, hot sauce, and
remaining 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning together in a large
bowl. Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces; add to bowl with
sauce mixture and toss well. Place chicken on the prepared
baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until just
beginning to get crisp, 5 to 10 minutes; remove to cool,
about 10 minutes. Combine green leafy lettuce, tomatoes,
cucumbers, and carrots in a salad bowl. Add Buffalo chicken
and blue cheese crumbles. Serve with your favorite dressing.
