Rotel Biscuit Bombs


Ingredients
1 tablespoon oil
1/2 cup chopped white onion
1/2 lb ground sirloin
1 tablespoons low sodium taco seasoning, plus more for garnish
1/2 (10-ounce) diced tomatoes with green chiles
4 ounces merican cheese
2 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuits, cold
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
taco sauce for dipping (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion
and cook, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Add ground
beef and cook, stirring, until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
minutes. Stir in taco seasoning and cook for 1 minute. Mix
in tomatoes and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring
constantly, until mixture comes to a simmer. Cook for 3
minutes and reduce heat to low. Add in cheese and stir until
melted and fully combined. Remove from heat and let cool
completely. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
C). Grease 2 12-cup muffin tins. Roll out biscuits, 1 at a
time, into 4-inch circles. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of
filling onto the center of each circle. Bring dough up
around the filling, pinching it together to seal the bottom.
Work your way around until the filling is fully encased in
the biscuit bomb. Place each biscuit bomb seam side down
into prepared muffin tins. Brush each biscuit bomb with
melted butter and sprinkle with taco seasoning. Bake in the
preheated oven, rotating once halfway through, until deep
golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Rest biscuit bombs on
a cooling rack for 15 minutes before eating. Serve on their
own or with taco sauce on the side for dipping.
