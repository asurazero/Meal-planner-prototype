Creamy Honey Mustard Chicken


Ingredients
scant 1/3 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 teaspoon paprika
4 (6 ounce) chicken breast cutlets
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup white wine
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
parsley

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. In a large resealable plastic bag,
combine flour, salt, pepper, granulated garlic, and paprika.
Mix the dry ingredients inside the bag by pinching the bag
several times. Pound chicken cutlets to 1/2-inch thickness
on a work surface and add to the flour mixture. Seal the
bag, and toss and move chicken inside the bag until lightly
coated with flour mixture. See note. Heat butter and olive
oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When butter stops
sizzling, carefully add chicken and cook until no longer
pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-
read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165
degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate and
keep warm. Pour chicken broth and wine into the same skillet
and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off the
bottom of the pan. Boil about 2 minutes. Stir honey and
mustard into wine mixture, and simmer about 1 minute. Remove
from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon cold butter until melted,
then stir in cream. Return chicken to the skillet. Serve
chicken warm with sauce. Garnish with parsley.
