Copycat Trader Joe's Gone Bananas


Ingredients
1 large banana
1 1/2 cups dark chocolate chips
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Cooking Instructions

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Slice banana into
1/4-inch thick rounds. Place rounds onto the lined sheet,
then place into the freezer. Freeze until solid, about 2
hours. Place chocolate chips, butter, and oil in a small
microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on 50% power for 1 to 2
minutes, stopping to stir every 30 seconds, until chocolate
is melted. Remove banana rounds from freezer. Place one
round onto a fork and dip into the chocolate until fully
coated. Shake to remove excess chocolate, then use another
fork to help slide the chocolate covered banana round back
onto the parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat process until
all banana pieces are coated in chocolate. Place chocolate
covered banana pieces back into the freezer until chocolate
is set, about 30 minutes. Keep stored in the freezer.
