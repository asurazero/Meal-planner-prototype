pork tenderloin


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Season pork tenderloin on all sides with sage, rosemary,
salt, and pepper; place into a slow cooker. Spoon blackberry
jam, 1/4 cup honey, and 2 tablespoons red wine over top.
Cover and cook on Low until very tender and slightly pink in
the center, 4 to 5 hours. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F
(63 degrees C). About 15 minutes before serving, bring
blackberries, 1/2 cup red wine, and 2 tablespoons honey to a
boil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Reduce the heat and
simmer until sauce thickens slightly and some berries burst,
about 15 minutes. To serve, slice tenderloin and spoon
blackberry sauce over top.
