Greek Couscous Salad


Ingredients
½ cup water
¼ cup chicken broth
1 teaspoon minced garlic
½ cup pearl (Israeli) couscous
1 cup canned chickpeas (garbanzo beans), rinsed and drained
¼ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
¼ cup sliced Kalamata olives
2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon ground black pepper

Cooking Instructions

Pour water and chicken broth into a saucepan; stir in the
garlic and bring to a boil. Stir in pearl couscous, cover
the pan, and remove from heat. Allow couscous to stand until
water has been absorbed, about 5 minutes; fluff with a fork.
Allow couscous to cool to warm temperature. Lightly toss
couscous, chickpeas, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and feta
cheese in a large serving bowl. To make the dressing: Mix
white wine vinegar, lemon juice, oregano, and black pepper
in a small bowl until well combined. Pour over couscous
mixture; toss again to serve.
