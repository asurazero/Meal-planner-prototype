Loaded Steak Fries


Ingredients
1 cup light beer
1/3 cup orcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon garlic
1 lime
1 pound sirloin filet steak
1 32 frozen French fries
cooking spray
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup half and half
2 cups white Cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried dill
1/2 cup tomato
2 tablespoons red onion
1 jalapeno, sliced

Cooking Instructions

Place beer, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, and
garlic in a resealable plastic bag. Squeeze in lime juice.
Add steak, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and
seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2
hours, or overnight. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220
degrees C). Spread fries onto a baking sheet and spray with
cooking spray. Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, 25 to
30 minutes, or per package instructions. Meanwhile, make
cheese sauce. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat;
whisk in flour; whisk continuously until mixture turns
golden and forms a smooth paste. Pour in half and half and
stir until mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cheese
until melted, 2 to 3 minutes more. Stir garlic powder,
oregano, and dill into the sauce. Meanwhile, preheat an
outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the
grate. Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess.
Discard remaining marinade. Cook steak on the preheated
until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 5
minutes per side for medium rare. An instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees
F (54 degrees C). Remove from the grill and let rest for 5
minutes before slicing. Place French fries evenly on a
platter; pour cheese sauce over fries. Top with sliced
steak, tomato, red onions, and thinly sliced jalapenos.
Serve immediately.
