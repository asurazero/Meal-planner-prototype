Ingredients
1 pear
1/2 onion
1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 cloves garlic
3 pounds beef tri-tip
2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
3 tablespoons gochujang
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon fresh ginger
1 garlic clove
1/2 cup water
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
4 scallions
1 (8 ounce) package cooked microwave basmati rice
kimchi
steamed vegetables for serving

Cooking Instructions

Combine pear, onion, ginger, 1/2 cup soy sauce, and 2 garlic
cloves in the jar of a blender or food processor and pulse
until marinade is smooth. Place tri-tip into a resealable
plastic bag with the marinade. Refrigerate for at least 4
hours or up to overnight. Slice tri-tip thinly against the
grain. Add grapeseed oil to a skillet over medium-high heat.
When skillet is hot, sear meat until nice and charred, about
1 minute on each side. Remove meat from pan. Add gochujang,
rice vinegar, soy sauce, white sugar, minced garlic, minced
ginger, and 1/2 cup water to the skillet. Stir until blended
and smooth. Simmer sauce for 3 minutes and return meat back
to the pan; simmer meat in sauce until heated through, 1 to
2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove bulgogi from
heat, drizzle with sesame oil, and sprinkle with sesame
seeds. Heat rice in the microwave for 90 seconds, or
according to package directions. Plate bulgogi with rice,
kimchi, and steamed veggies. Garnish with sliced scallions.
