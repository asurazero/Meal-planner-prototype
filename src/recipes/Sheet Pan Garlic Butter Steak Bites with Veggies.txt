Sheet Pan Garlic Butter Steak Bites with Veggies


Ingredients
1 pound potatoes,
12 ounces green beans,
1 small red onion,
2 tablespoons olive oil,
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt,
1/2 teaspoon black pepper,
1 pound sirloin steak,
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons butter
1 clove garlic
2 teaspoons fresh rosemary

Cooking Instructions

Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly
coat a 10x15-inch baking sheet with cooking spray. Toss
together potatoes, green beans, onion, 1 tablespoon oil, and
1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Spread
vegetable mixture in an even layer on the prepared pan.
Roast vegetables in the center of the preheated oven,
stirring halfway through, 15 minutes. Meanwhile, toss
together steak; Worcestershire sauce; and remaining 1
tablespoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper
in same medium bowl. Preheat the broiler. Push vegetables to
edges of pan. Arrange steak in an even layer in center of
pan. Broil, turning steak halfway through, until desired
doneness (140 to 145 degrees F (60 to 63 degrees C) for
medium), 6 to 8 minutes. Melt butter in a small saucepan
over low heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30
seconds. Drizzle garlic butter over steak and vegetables.
Sprinkle with rosemary.
