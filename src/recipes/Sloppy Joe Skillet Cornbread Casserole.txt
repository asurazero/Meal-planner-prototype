Sloppy Joe Skillet Cornbread Casserole


Ingredients
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 green bell pepper,
1 small onion,
2 cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons mustard
2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon hot sauce, such as TabascoÂ®
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1/2 cup water
3 pickle spears
2 (8.5 ounce) boxes corn muffin mix,
1 large egg
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup sour cream
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat oil
in a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add
bell pepper, onion, garlic, and salt and cook, stirring
often, until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add in
beef and cook, crumbling with a wooden spoon until browned,
5 to 7 minutes. Add in ketchup, mustard, brown sugar,
Worcestershire, and black pepper, and cook 1 minute,
stirring constantly. Mix in 2 teaspoons of hot sauce, tomato
paste, and water, and stir to combine. Bring mixture to a
simmer, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
sauce has thickened slightly. Remove from heat; smooth
mixture out evenly in skillet. Lay pickle slices evenly over
the top. Stir together cornbread mix, egg, milk, sour cream,
Cheddar cheese, and remaining hot sauce in a bowl until
combined. Pour batter evenly over meat mixture. Bake in the
preheated oven until golden brown and bubbly around the
edges, 23 to 25 minutes.
