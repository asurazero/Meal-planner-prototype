Pumpkin Tiramisu Bundt Cake


Ingredients
2 1/4 cups cake flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup light brown sugar
3 large eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
3/4 cup mascarpone cheese
1/4 cup whole milk
1 cup water
3 tablespoons espresso powder
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 cup coffee liqueur
1/4 cup mascarpone
1 cup confectioner's sugar
2 tablespoons whole milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cocoa powder

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
10-cup Bundt pan with a baking spray containing flour. Sift
together cake flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking
soda, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. Beat butter,
white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large bowl until
light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add in eggs 1 at a time,
beating well after each addition, then turn mixer to medium-
high and beat batter for an additional 3 minutes. Add in
pumpkin, mascarpone, whole milk, and vanilla, and beat until
completely incorporated. Add in half the dry ingredients and
mix until just combined. Add in remaining dry ingredients
and mix until just combined. Pour batter evenly into the
prepared pan. Tap pan sharply on the counter several times
to remove any larger air bubbles. Bake in the preheated oven
until a bamboo skewer inserted into the center of the cake
comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes. Cool cake in pan for 5
minutes. Meanwhile, for espresso syrup, stir hot water,
espresso powder, sugar, and coffee liqueur together until
completely combined and dissolved. Use a bamboo skewer to
poke several holes all over the bottom of the cake, only
going about 3/4 of the way into the cake. Gradually drizzle
espresso syrup over cake, letting it soak in slightly before
adding more. It will seem like a lot of liquid, but it will
all soak in. Continue to cool cake in the pan for 20 minutes
more, then carefully invert onto a serving platter to cool
completely. For icing, whisk together mascarpone,
confectionerâ€™s sugar, whole milk, vanilla, and salt until
smooth and combined. Drizzle icing over cooled cake. Sift
cocoa powder over icing before it sets. Serve cake at room
temp for best flavor and texture, but store any extra in the
refrigerator.
