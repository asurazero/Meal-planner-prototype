Sheet Pan Hawaiian Chicken


Ingredients
1/4 cup pineapple juice
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons ketchup
1/2 teaspoon fresh ginger
1 teaspoon garlic
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 (8 ounce) chicken breast
1 green bell pepper,
1 red bell pepper
1 red onion
2 cups broccoli florets,
1 cup pineapple chunks
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a
large sheet pan with foil. For sauce, whisk pineapple juice,
brown sugar, soy sauce, ketchup, ginger, garlic, and
cornstarch together in a bowl. Arrange chicken, green bell
pepper, red bell pepper, onion, broccoli, and pineapple on
the prepared sheet pan. Season with salt and pepper. Pour
half of sauce over chicken and vegetables; set aside
remaining sauce. Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables
are tender and chicken is no longer pink at the center,
about 25 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted near
the center should reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Meanwhile, microwave remaining sauce on High until slightly
thickened, about 30 seconds. Cut chicken into pieces,
drizzle sauce over chicken and vegetables, and toss to coat.
