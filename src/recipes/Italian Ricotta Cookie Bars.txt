Italian Ricotta Cookie Bars


Ingredients
1/2 cup unsalted butter,
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 extra large eggs
8 ounces whole milk ricotta cheese
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon unsalted butter,
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
3 teaspoons whole milk
sprinkles

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a
9x9-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have
overhang on all sides, and lightly grease the parchment. For
cookie bars, beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, salt,
and nutmeg together in a bowl with an electric mixer until
light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add in eggs and beat for 1
more minute. Add in ricotta, lemon zest, lemon juice, and
vanilla and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Add in flour
and baking soda and mix until just combined. Transfer batter
into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer. Bake
until golden and the center of the bars feel just set when
lightly touched, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and
allow to cool completely. For icing, mix together powdered
sugar, melted butter, lemon juice, vanilla, pinch of salt
and 3 teaspoons of milk until smooth. If glaze is too thick,
add another teaspoon of milk until it is a pourable
consistency. Pour glaze over bars and spread into an even
layer. Sprinkle nonpareils over icing before it sets. Allow
glaze to set before cutting into 16 bars. Bars can be placed
in the refrigerator to speed up setting. Keep bars stored in
the refrigerator, but bring to room temperature to serve.
