Skillet Pork Chops with Mushroom Gravy


Ingredients
4 pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
1 onion, sliced
2 cups mushrooms
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup white wine
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, or to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
fresh thyme sprigs for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Blot chops dry with paper towels and season both sides with
salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1
tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-
high heat. When butter sizzles, add chops and brown on both
sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chops from the
skillet and keep warm. To the same skillet, add remaining
olive oil and butter. When butter is melted, add onions,
mushrooms, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring, until
onions begin to turn translucent and mushrooms are softened,
4 to 5 minutes. Stir in minced garlic and cook until
fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chicken stock, wine, and
dried thyme, and bring to a boil. Return chops and any
accumulated juices to the skillet, nestling chops down into
vegetables and broth. Remove about 1/4 cup of broth for
later use. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until an
instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 145
degrees F (63 degrees C), 4 to 5 minutes. See note. Stir
cornstarch into the reserved cooking liquid, and stir until
there are no lumps. While stirring the skillet sauce, add
cornstarch mixture, and continue stirring 3 to 4 minutes, or
until the sauce thickens. Serve chops with mushrooms and
sauce on top, and garnish with fresh thyme sprigs, if
desired.
