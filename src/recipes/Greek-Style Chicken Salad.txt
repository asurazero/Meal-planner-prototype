Greek-Style Chicken Salad


Ingredients
1 cup diced English cucumbers
1 ¼ teaspoons salt, divided
2 tablespoons diced red onion
1 cup Greek yogurt
⅓ cup chopped Kalamata olives
1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh dill
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon garlic, minced
1 teaspoon lemon zest
½ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups diced cooked chicken
¾ cup crumbled feta cheese
½ cup diced seeded plum tomatoes
1 head Bibb lettuce, or more as needed

Cooking Instructions

Place cucumbers in a colander; set onto a plate. Toss
cucumbers with 1 teaspoon salt. Let rest to draw about
liquid, about 30 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels. Place
red onion and 1 cup cold water in a bowl. Let soak until the
strong onion flavor is weakened, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and
rinse. Combine cucumbers, red onions, Greek yogurt, Kalamata
olives, dill, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, lemon zest,
oregano, and black pepper in a bowl. Fold in chicken, feta
cheese, and tomatoes. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate
salad for at least 1 hour. Stir salad and serve on lettuce
leaves.
