Plum Muffins


Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 cups plums
1/3 cup chopped almonds
3 tablespoons candied ginger (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a
standard 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners. Whisk flour,
sugar, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, powdered ginger,
and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Whisk eggs, milk,
and almond extract together in a bowl or cup; continue
whisking and pour in melted butter until combined. Add egg
mixture to flour mixture, and stir just until dry
ingredients are moistened. Fold in chopped plums and chopped
almonds. Divide evenly among the 12 muffin cups, and
sprinkle candied ginger over the muffin tops. Bake muffins
in the preheated oven until muffins spring back when lightly
touched, 23 to 25 minutes. Remove to cool on a rack, 5 to 10
minutes. Serve warm, or at room temperature. Store leftover
muffins when cool in an airtight container for 2 to 3 days,
or wrap and freeze.
