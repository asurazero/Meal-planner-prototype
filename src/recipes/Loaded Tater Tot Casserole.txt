1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cups milk
8 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (32-ounce) package frozen bite-sized potato nuggets (Tater TotsÂ®
1/2 cup sour cream
1 bunch green onions
1/4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon milk

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(230 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart square baking dish. Cook
bacon in a large skillet until crisp, about 8 minutes. Drain
on paper towels. When cool enough to handle, crumble bacon.
Drain all but 2 tablespoons bacon drippings from the
skillet. Add onion to the skillet. Cook and stir until
tender, about 5 minutes. Add flour and cayenne pepper to
skillet; cook and stir 1 minute. Add 2 cups milk to the
skillet. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly, about 3
minutes. Gradually add 1 cup cheese to skillet, stirring
until melted. Stir in half of green onions. Place 1/2 cup
sour cream in a small bowl. Gradually whisk in about 1/2 cup
of hot sauce mixture. Return mixture to the skillet. Return
to a simmer. Add half of tots to the prepared baking dish.
Top with half of sauce and half of bacon. Top with remaining
tots, remaining sauce, remaining bacon, and remaining
cheese. Bake until bubbly and cheese on top is lightly
browned, 35 minutes. For dill cream, whisk together 1/4 cup
sour cream, 1 tablespoon milk, and dill. Drizzle over the
casserole and top with remaining green onions.
