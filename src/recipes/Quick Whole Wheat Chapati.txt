Quick Whole Wheat Chapati


Ingredients
2 ½ cups whole wheat flour
¾ teaspoon salt
1 cup water

Cooking Instructions

Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Stir in water to form
a soft dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work
surface and knead several times. Divide into 8 pieces and
roll each into a ball. Roll each ball into a very thin round
using a rolling pin. Heat a griddle over medium-high heat.
Cook each dough round on griddle until dough bubbles and
blisters appear, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until
lightly browned on the other side.
