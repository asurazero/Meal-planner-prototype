Crockpot Caesar Chicken Pasta


Ingredients
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 1 (32-ounce carton) reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 (16-ounce) bottle creamy Caesar salad dressing
1 pound rotini pasta
1 (8- ounce) package cream cheese, cubed and softened
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1/4 cup chopped chopped
crushed red pepper, to taste (optional)
capers for topping, to taste (optional)
lemon wedges for serving (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Lightly coat the bottom of a 5- to
6-quart slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. Place
chicken breasts in a single layer in the slow cooker and
sprinkle with garlic powder and lemon zest. Pour chicken
broth and Caesar dressing over the chicken. Cover and cook
on Low for 5 hours or on High for 2 1/2 hours or until an
instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the
chicken registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove
chicken from the slow cooker and allow to cool slightly on a
cutting board before shredding or chopping into bite-sized
pieces. Meanwhile, stir the pasta into the dressing mixture
in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on High 20 to 30 minutes
more or until pasta is tender. Stir in cream cheese and 1/4
cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted. Add shredded
chicken, and parsley; stir to combine. Turn cooker off and
let pasta mixture stand, uncovered to allow sauce to thicken
slightly, 10 minutes. Top with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan
cheese and if desired, top with crushed red pepper, capers,
and/or lemon wedges.
