1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1 pound ground sirloin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup water
1 pie crust deep dish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat oil
in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and 1/2
teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.
Add ground beef in one layer, crumbling slightly with a
wooden spoon to spread it into the skillet. Cook,
undisturbed, until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir and
continue cooking until beef is no longer pink. Season with
remaining salt, chili powder, cumin, cayenne, garlic powder,
onion powder, and pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add water
and cook for 2 minutes, scraping pan to release any browned
bits. Remove from heat and set aside. Spread beans over the
bottom of the pie crust. Sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese evenly over
the beans. Top with ground beef mixture, green chiles, hot
sauce, and 3/4 cup cheese. Cover with foil and bake in the
preheated oven until bubbly and crust is golden brown, about
30 minutes. Uncover, top with remaining cheese and crushed
chips and return to the oven, Bake until bubbly and cheese
has melted and chips have very lightly browned, about 5 more
minutes. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before serving with
toppings of choice and more hot sauce if desired.
