Ultimate Pumpkin Custard Pie


Ingredients
1
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon cardamom
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
1/4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste
2/3 cup sugar
3 tablespoons bourbon whiskey
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
whipped cream for serving (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and set a
rack in the center. Lightly flour a work surface, and roll
pastry to a 14-inch round. Press dough evenly into the
bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Trim any excess dough
and flute the edges. Freeze pie shell for 15 minutes or
refrigerate for 30 minutes before baking, Poke bottom and
sides of pie shell with the tines of a fork; line with
parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans.
Bake crust in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Carefully
remove weights and parchment and return the shell to the
oven. Continue baking until golden and firm to the touch,
about 5 more minutes. Set aside to cool while preparing
filling. Add eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves,
allspice, cardamom, and salt to a large bowl; whisk until
well combined. Whisk in whipping cream, sour cream, vanilla
bean paste, sugar, bourbon and pumpkin pur√©e until well
combined. Pour mixture into pie shell. Bake in the preheated
oven until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean,
50 to 60 minutes. Transfer the pie to a rack to cool
completely.
