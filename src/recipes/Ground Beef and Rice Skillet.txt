Ground Beef and Rice Skillet


Ingredients
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper,
2 cloves garlic
1 cup white rice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 1/2 cups lower-sodium beef broth
1 (4 ounce can) green chiles
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 cup Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese
1 tablespoon green onion or cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Cook ground beef, onion, red bell
pepper, and garlic in an extra-large tall-sided skillet over
medium heat until beef is no longer pink and vegetables are
tender, stirring occasionally to break up large chunks of
ground beef, about 8 minutes; drain fat. Stir in rice, salt,
and cumin. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste.
Cook and stir for 1 minute. Mix in undrained diced tomatoes,
broth, diced chiles, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to
boiling. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until liquid is
reduced and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove skillet
from heat. Sprinkle with cheese. Cover and let stand until
cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Garnish with green onion.
