Whole Orange Blender Cake


Ingredients
1 orange
3 large eggs
1/3 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon orange juice

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(180 degrees C). Coat an 8x4-inch loaf pan with nonstick
spray and line with parchment paper. Wash the orange and
blot dry with paper towels. Cut in 8ths, removing any seeds.
Combine orange pieces, eggs, sugar, melted butter, and
vanilla in a blender. Cover and blend until smooth, about 30
seconds. Add flour, baking powder, and salt. Cover and pulse
just until combined and batter is smooth. Add batter to
prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the
center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pan on
a wire rack 10 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely
on a wire rack. Whisk together powdered sugar and orange
juice until smooth. Drizzle over the cooled loaf.
