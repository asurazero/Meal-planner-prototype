Easy Roasted Beef Tenderloin


Ingredients
butcher's twine
1 (3 pound) beef tenderloin
1 tablespoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Cut butcherâ€™s twine into 5 or 6 (8-inch) pieces. Wrap each
piece firmly around the tenderloin, spaced about 1 1/2
inches apart, and secure with a knot. Trim off any excess
twine. Cut a longer piece of twine and wrap it horizontally
around the beef; run the ends of the twine under the center
pieces and tie a firm knot in the center. Trim off any
excess. Refrigerate tenderloin for 30 minutes uncovered.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Set a
wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Season tenderloin
evenly with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet
over medium-high heat. Place meat in skillet and cook,
undisturbed, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat
on all sides until evenly browned. Transfer tenderloin to
the prepared wire rack. Bake in the preheated oven until an
instant read thermometer inserted near the center reaches
125 degrees F (52 degrees C), 35 to 40 minutes for medium
rare, or cook to desired degree of doneness. Transfer to a
cutting board to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.
