Cream Cheese Biscuits


Ingredients
4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
2 teaspoons kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup unsalted butter
4 ounces cold cream cheese
1 1/2 cups whole buttermilk

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking
soda in a large bowl until combined. Add butter and cream
cheese and mix in with a pastry cutter or two forks until
mixture is crumbly and resembles a coarse meal. Pour in the
1 1/2 cups buttermilk and gently stir until mixture
resembles a shaggy, slightly sticky dough. Turn dough onto a
lightly floured work surface and knead a few times to
combine. Lightly coat hands and rolling pin with flour;
gently pat and roll dough to 3/4-inch-thickness, adding more
flour as needed to keep dough from sticking. Use a 3-inch
biscuit cutter, dipping biscuit cutter in flour between
cuts, to cut into 12 biscuits, rerolling dough scraps once.
Place biscuits onto prepared baking sheet about 3/4-inch
apart. Brush tops of biscuits with remaining 1 tablespoon
buttermilk. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown,
15 to 17 minutes. Serve warm.
