spaghetti and meatballs


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine
tomatoes, tomato juice, tomato paste, onion, parsley, salt,
red pepper flakes, black pepper, thyme, and cloves in a
large pot. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to
low and let simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, combine
beef, crackers, eggs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, parsley, and
thyme in a bowl. Form into large meatballs and place into a
broiler pan. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and no
longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes. Transfer
meatballs to sauce and continue to simmer, 2 to 2 1/2 hours
more. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,
until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Serve sauce and meatballs over cooked spaghetti.
