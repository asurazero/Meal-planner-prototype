Greek Smashed Pita


Ingredients
12 ounces ground sirloin
2 cloves garlic,
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
4 pitas
1 1/2 cups shredded Romaine lettuce
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1 tablespoon dill
2 tablespoons pepperoncini pepper slices
3 tablespoons red onion
1/4 cup feta cheese
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup tzatziki sauce
1 Roma tomato, thinly sliced

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Combine meat with garlic, cumin,
paprika, salt, and pepper and mix until well incorporated.
Divide mixture evenly into 4 portions. Press each portion
onto the top of 1 pita; press and spread meat almost to the
edges. Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat
until hot. Place pita meat side down in skillet. Press pita
down with the back of a spatula so that meat stays thin
while it cooks. Cook, undisturbed, until browned and meat
easily releases from the pan, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook
1 more minute. Repeat with remaining pitas. Toss lettuce,
parsley, dill, pepperoncini, red onion, feta, lemon juice,
and tzatziki together in a bowl until well combined. Divide
salad mixture among pitas and top evenly with tomato slices.
Fold in half and serve immediately. Enjoy!
