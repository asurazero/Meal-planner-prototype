Individual Bourbon-Pecan French Toast Bakes


Ingredients
1 cup whole milk
4 large eggs
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2 tablespoons Bourbon whiskey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 cups whole-grain or challah bread cubes
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 cup butter
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup chopped pecans
confectioners sugar, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Grease 4 (8 to 10 ounce) ramekins. Whisk together milk,
eggs, maple syrup, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt in a
large bowl. Add bread. Toss to combine. Divide among
prepared ramekins. Chill, covered, at least 2 hours or up to
overnight. Meanwhile, make Toasted Pecan Butter: Preheat the
oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread pecans on a
rimmed baking sheet. Toast in the preheated oven, stirring
once or twice, until lightly browned and fragrant, 12 to 15
minutes. Watch closely so they donâ€™t burn. Let cool to room
temperature. Pulse butter, brown sugar, and vanilla in a
food processor until combined. Add cooled pecans. Pulse
until mixture reaches desired consistency. Chill Toasted
Pecan Butter in an airtight container up to 1 month. To
assemble: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
For streusel, stir together flour and brown sugar in a
medium bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender or 2 knives
until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; stir in pecans.
Sprinkle streusel over bread mixture in ramekins. Bake in
the preheated oven until puffed and a knife inserted into
centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Serve warm with
Toasted Pecan Butter and garnish with powdered sugar.
