Cowboy Lasagna


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound ground sirloin
1 pound sage-flavored pork sausage
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
1 onion,
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 ounces pepperoni, roughly chopped
1 (15 ounce) can fire roasted diced tomatoes
1 (12-ounce) can tomato paste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 cups water
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pound lasagna noodles
cooking spray
16 ounces ricotta cheese
16 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded
2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Heat oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add
ground beef and sausage and cook, crumbling with a wooden
spoon until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add jalapeno, onion,
and garlic and cook, stirring often, until vegetables are
softened, about 3 minutes. Add in pepperoni, tomatoes,
tomato paste, oregano, and water and stir until well
combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a
simmer, reduce heat and cook, uncovered, stirring
occasionally while pasta is prepared. Preheat the oven to
350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly
salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling
water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish
with cooking spray. Spread a thin layer of sauce over the
bottom of the prepared dish. Top with a layer of lasagna
noodles, 1/2 of ricotta, and 1/3 of mozzarella cheese.
Sprinkle with 1/3 of grated Parmesan cheese and 1/3 of sauce
mixture. Repeat that layer once more. Top with remaining
sauce, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan. Bake in the
preheated oven until browned around the edges and bubbly,
about 40 minutes.
