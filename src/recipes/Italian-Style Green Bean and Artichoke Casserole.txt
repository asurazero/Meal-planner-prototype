Italian-Style Green Bean and Artichoke Casserole


Ingredients
1 1/4 cups bread crumbs
1 1/4 cups grated Parmesan cheese
3 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon pepper
2 (9 ounce) packages frozen artichoke hearts
3 (28 ounce) cans green beans
2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
chopped parsley for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly
grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine Italian bread
crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large
bowl. Reserve 1/3 cup breadcrumb mixture and set aside. Add
artichokes, green beans, and 1/2 cup olive oil to the bowl
and gently fold to combine well. Pour mixture into the
prepared baking dish and sprinkle with reserved breadcrumb
mixture. Drizzle with remaining olive oil; cover with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 30
minutes. Uncover and bake until lightly golden and bubbly
around the edges, 10 to 15 minutes more. Sprinkle with
parsley and serve.
