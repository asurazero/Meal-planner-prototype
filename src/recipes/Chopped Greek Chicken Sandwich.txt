Chopped Greek Chicken Sandwich


Ingredients
1 sandwich roll
6 ounces cooked chicken
1/4 cup green pepper
4 grape tomatoes
4 slices English cucumber
6 Greek olives
3 slices red onion,
1 cup Romaine
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste
1/4 cup feta cheese
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Cut sandwich roll 3/4 of the way in, and if desired, remove
some of the crumb from the inside to make more room for
filling. Pile up chicken, green pepper, tomatoes, cucumber,
olives, and onion. Season with salt, black pepper, cayenne,
and oregano, and then use a cleaver or large knife to chop
everything into about 1/2-inch pieces. Add Romaine, and chop
again until everything into about 1/4-inch pieces, or as
fine as you want. Top with feta, lemon juice, and olive oil.
Perform one last, brief chopping until everything is evenly
mixed. Taste and adjust seasoning. Transfer filling into
roll, and serve immediately.
