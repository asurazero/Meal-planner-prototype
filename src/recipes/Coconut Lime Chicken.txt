Coconut Lime Chicken


Ingredients
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
5 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon onion powder
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon fresh ginger
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1 (13 2/3 ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon riracha,
1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest
1/4 cup lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 tablespon cilantro, or as needed
lime wedges
unsweetened coconut flakes (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season both
sides of the chicken thighs with paprika, salt, onion
powder, garlic powder, and black pepper. Place chicken in
pan and sear until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip chicken
over and cook until browned, 6 to 8 minutes more. Remove
chicken to a plate. Add onion, garlic, and ginger to the
skillet. Cook until onion is softened and translucent, 3 to
4 minutes, stirring often. Add in chicken stock, coconut
milk, honey, Sriracha, and soy sauce. Bring mixture to a
simmer, and reduce heat to low. Cook sauce for 5 minutes,
stirring often. In a small bowl or measuring cup, stir lime
juice and cornstarch together. Stir cornstarch mixture and
lime zest into the pan, and cook, stirring constantly, until
sauce begins to thicken, 5 to 8 minutes. Taste sauce, and
adjust salt, pepper, honey and Sriracha amounts as needed.
Add chicken thighs and any accumulated juices back to the
skillet. Continue cooking until chicken is heated and cooked
through, 5 to 10 minutes more. To serve, sprinkle fresh
cilantro over the chicken, and squeeze more fresh lime juice
over the top if desired. Sprinkle with toasted coconut, if
desired.
