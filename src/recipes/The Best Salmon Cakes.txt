The Best Salmon Cakes


Ingredients
cooking spray
1 tablespoon butter
1/3 cup red onion
1/4 cup red bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped celery
3 tablespoons chopped parsley
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon Old Bay
1 large egg, beaten
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 2/3 cups panko breadcrumbs, divided
2 cups salmon
3 tablespoons vegetable oil

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set a
wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and spray with
cooking spray. Heat butter in a small skillet over medium-
high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery and cook,
stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Remove from
heat, let cool slightly, and add to a bowl. Add parsley,
Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, Worcestershire, Old Bay, egg,
lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and mix until well combined.
Stir in 2/3 cup bread crumbs until moistened. Fold in salmon
and mix until just combined. Add remaining breadcrumbs to a
shallow dish. Form salmon mixture into 6 balls. Roll each
ball in breadcrumbs to cover completely; gently flatten
balls into patties. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-
high heat. Add half patties to skillet and cook, turning
once, until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer
patties to prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining
patties. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 10
to 15 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted near the
center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
