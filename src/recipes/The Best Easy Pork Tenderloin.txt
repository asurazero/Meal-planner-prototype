The Best Easy Pork Tenderloin


Ingredients
2 pork tenderloins (1 lb. each)
1 1/2 salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 garlic
2 teaspoon h h
4 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 cup white wine

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Trim the
silver skin from each pork tenderloin and season evenly with
salt, pepper, garlic, and herbes de Provence. Heat oil in a
large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat until barely
shimmering. Add both pork tenderloins and cook, undisturbed,
until golden brown and easily release from the pan, about 5
minutes. Flip each piece and cook for an additional 3
minutes undisturbed. Add wine and cook for 1 minute. Remove
pan from the stove and place in the oven. Bake in the
preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, 15
to 19 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes
before slicing. Serve with pan juices.
