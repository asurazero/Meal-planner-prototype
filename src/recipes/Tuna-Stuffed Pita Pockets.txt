Tuna-Stuffed Pita Pockets


Ingredients
2 teaspoons lime juice
1 teaspoon ijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
5 ounce tuna in water
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped red onion
1 tablespoon chopped cucumber
1 tablespoon fresh parsley
1 tablespoon capers (optional)
salt
1 6-inch pita
2 lettuce leaves
6 cherry tomatoes, halved
2 tablespoons sliced Kalamata olives
2 tablespoons feta cheese

Cooking Instructions

Stir lime juice, Dijon, and sugar together in a small bowl.
Gradually whisk in olive oil until dressing thickens
slightly. Place tuna in a separate bowl; add onion,
cucumber, parsley, and capers. Drizzle dressing over tuna
mixture and stir gently, trying to keep tuna chunky. Season
with salt and pepper. Slice pita in half and open halves to
form pockets. Place leaf lettuce in the pita halves, and
spoon in tuna mixture. Top with tomatoes, olives, and feta
cheese. Serve immediately.
