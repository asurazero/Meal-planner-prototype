Tortilla Scrambled Egg and Cheese


Ingredients
1 large egg
1 teaspoon milk
1 1/2 teaspoons butter
1 (7 inch) flour tortilla
2 slices jalapeno pepper jack cheese

Cooking Instructions

Whisk egg and milk together in a small bowl. Melt butter in
a skillet over medium heat. Pour in egg mixture and tilt
skillet until egg covers the skillet. Cook until egg is set,
about 2 minutes. Place flour tortilla over egg, and
carefully flip egg and tortilla so that the tortilla is now
on the bottom. Place cheese slices over egg. Cook until
tortilla is crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Cover skillet and cook
until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.
