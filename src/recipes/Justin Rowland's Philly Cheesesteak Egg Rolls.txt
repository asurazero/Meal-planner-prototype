Justin Rowland's Philly Cheesesteak Egg Rolls


Ingredients
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 white onion
12.5 ounces shaved ribeye meat
garlic powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers
4 slices white American cheese, cut in half
2 large eggs, beaten
2 cups oil
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup mayonnaise

Cooking Instructions

Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil and
onions and let cook for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring every 2
minutes. Once onions are a little crisp, add shaved ribeye
meat. Stir in garlic and season with salt and pepper.
Continue to cook until steak is fully cooked, about 10
minutes. Transfer meat mixture to a large mixing bowl. Place
an egg roll wrapper on a clear work surface like a diamond
and add a slice of cheese. Wet corners with the eggs. Fold
bottom corner over the filling, fold 2 sides inwards, and
roll up tightly. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven to 350
degrees F (180 degrees C). Check temperature with a deep fry
thermometer. Working in batches, add 2 to 3 egg rolls at a
time to the hot oil, making sure to not overcrowd the pot.
Fry until golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to
a paper towel lined plate to drain. Meanwhile, stir together
ketchup and mayonnaise in a bowl for the dipping sauce.
Slice egg rolls diagonally on a cutting board and serve with
the dipping sauce.
