One-Pot Cheeseburger Pasta


Ingredients
1 pound
1 yellow onion, finely chopped
6 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
4 cups beef broth
1 15-ounce) canned crushed tomatoes
1/4 cup drained hamburger dill pickle chips,
3 tablespoons yellow mustard
3 tablespoons ketchup
8 ounces cavatappi pasta
(8-ounce) sharp Cheddar cheese
2 ounces cream cheese, cut into pieces
toasted sesame seeds

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Heat a large nonstick skillet over
medium-high heat. Add beef, onion, garlic, salt, and black
pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until beef is no
longer pink and onions are translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Add
tomato paste, onion powder, paprika, and garlic powder, and
cook, stirring constantly, until tomato paste coats beef
mixture, about 1 minute. Stir in broth, crushed tomatoes,
pickles, mustard, and ketchup; bring to a boil over medium-
high heat. Stir in pasta, making sure it is fully submerged
in liquid. Cook over medium-high, stirring occasionally,
until pasta is al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat
and add Cheddar cheese and cream cheese, stirring
constantly, until melted, about 2 minutes. Divide pasta
among bowls and garnish with pickle chips, sesame seeds, and
scallions.
