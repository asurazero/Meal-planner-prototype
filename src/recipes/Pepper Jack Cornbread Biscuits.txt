Pepper Jack Cornbread Biscuits


Ingredients
2 cups self-rising flour (see Tip)
1 cup yellow cornmeal
2 tablespoons white sugar
½ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 stick (1/2 cup) very cold unsalted butter, cubed
1 ¼ cups cold buttermilk
2 ounces pepper Jack cheese
2 tablespoons melted butter for brushing tops

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Mix together self-rising flour,
cornmeal, white sugar, salt, and baking soda (See Cook's
Note for substitution). Add cubed, very cold butter and mix
in with a pastry cutter/blender until the mixture is crumbly
and the butter pieces are approximately the size of lentils.
Stir in the buttermilk with a fork until a crumbly dough
forms, which can be pressed together with your hands. Press
into a square, and roll out into a 12 x12-inch square. Cut
in half, and stack one piece on the other. Roll back out to
a 12-inch square. Jagged edges are fine, and can simply be
pressed in with a bench scraper. Cut into quarters, and
stack up. Square up the sides a little by pressing in with a
bench scraper, and roll back out to a 12-inch square.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with a Silpat mat. Grate the pepper Jack cheese
over the top of the dough (for best results, pop cheese in
the freezer for a few minutes to firm up, making it easier
to grate and distribute evenly). Fold into thirds to form a
rectangle, and press lightly. Roll until the rectangle is
about 3/4 inch thick, and then use a floured round cutter
(mine was 2.75 inches) to punch out 8 biscuits. Dough can
also be cut into squares instead. Transfer cut dough to the
prepared baking sheet. Extra dough can be pressed together
and re-rolled, and used to cut more biscuits. Press each
biscuit lightly in the center with your thumb. Brush each
biscuit lightly with melted butter. Bake in the preheated
oven until nicely risen and golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
While still warm, brush with more melted butter if desired.
Let cool before serving. Enjoy!
