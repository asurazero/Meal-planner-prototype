Cheesy Bacon Ranch Burger Sliders


Ingredients
1/2 cup ranch dressing
1 tablespoon hot sauce
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 tablespoon ranch seasoning
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
8 slices bacon
1 (12 count) package Hawaiian rolls
8 slices Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup red onion
12 dill pickle slices

Cooking Instructions

Stir together ranch dressing and hot sauce in a small bowl
and set aside. Mix beef with ranch seasoning, salt, and
pepper in a large bowl and shape meat mixture into 2 large
rectangular shapes, about 7 inches by 5 inches each. Place
bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat,
turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10
minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; chop bacon when
cool enough to handle. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-
high heat. Slice rolls in half horizontally, keeping tops
and bottom pieces connected. Place rolls on grill, cut side
down, and cook just until toasted, about 10 seconds. Remove
and set aside. Add burger patties to grill and cook,
undisturbed, until browned, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook
until browned and to your preferred doneness, about 4
minutes more. Top each patty with 4 slices cheese and cover
grill just untiul cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Spread
bottom halves of rolls with half of ranch dressing mixture.
Place burgers on top and then top with chopped bacon, onion,
and pickle slices. Drizzle with desired amount of remaining
dressing and place bun tops on top. Cut into 12 sliders and
serve.
