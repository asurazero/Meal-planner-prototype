Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a
9x5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.
Combine flour, peanut butter powder, baking powder, and salt
in a bowl. Set aside. Mix peanut butter, milk, and brown
sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until fully
combined. Add flour mixture and mix on low speed just until
flour disappears; stir in peanuts. Scoop batter into the
prepared loaf pan and smooth out with a spatula. Bake in the
preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center
comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire
rack for 10 minutes, remove from the pan, then cool
completely on the wire rack.
