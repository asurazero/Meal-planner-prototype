Garlic Mashed Cauliflower


Ingredients
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 pounds riced cauliflower
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch nutmeg
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon chives

Cooking Instructions

Melt butter in a large skillet, over medium heat. Add minced
garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in
thawed, riced cauliflower, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Add
chicken broth and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.
Cook, covered, about 8 minutes, then remove cover and
continue cooking and stirring until most of the liquid
evaporates, an additional 5 to 8 minutes. Use an immersion
blender to purée cauliflower until smooth. If an immersion
blender is not available, spoon cauliflower into a blender
to purée. When smooth, place in a serving bowl and garnish
with snipped chives.
