Grilled Salmon


Ingredients
1 ½ pounds salmon fillets
lemon pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste
salt to taste
⅓ cup soy sauce
⅓ cup brown sugar
⅓ cup water
¼ cup vegetable oil

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Season salmon fillets with lemon
pepper, garlic powder, and salt. Stir soy sauce, brown
sugar, water, and vegetable oil together in a small bowl
until sugar is dissolved. Place fish in a large resealable
plastic bag; add soy sauce mixture, seal, and turn to coat.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill
for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Place salmon on
the preheated grill, and discard marinade. Cook salmon until
fish flakes easily with a fork, about 6 to 8 minutes per
side. Serve and enjoy!
