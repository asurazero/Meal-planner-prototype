Spinach Lemon Chicken Bake


Ingredients
4 6-ounce) boneless chicken breasts
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion
3 cloves garlic,
3/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon lemon zest
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon fresh rosemary
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 (5-ounce) packages baby spinach
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
lemon slices

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C). Place a chicken breast between two sheets
of plastic wrap and set on a cutting board. Pound with a
meat mallet to 1/2-inch thickness. Repeat with remaining
chicken. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Then
sprinkle chicken generously with flour, shaking off excess.
Heat oil in an ovenproof 12-inch skillet over medium-high
heat. Add chicken to the skillet and brown 3 minutes per
side (chicken may not be fully cooked). Transfer chicken
from the skillet to a plate. Reduce heat to medium. Add
onion to the skillet; cook and stir until tender, 4 minutes.
Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add
broth, cream, lemon zest and juice, rosemary, and crushed
red pepper. Bring to a boil, about 2 minutes. Add spinach,
in batches, stirring until wilted, about 1 minute. Stir in
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and simmer until desired
consistency, about 5 minutes. Return chicken to skillet.
Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Bake in the
preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and sauce is
bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant read thermometer,
inserted into the thickest part of chicken, should read 165
degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve garnished with lemon slices.
