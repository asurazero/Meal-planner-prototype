Wet Wet Sauce


Ingredients
1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons ginger
3 tablespoons Korean chili flakes
2 teaspoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
3 tablespoons rice vinegar

Cooking Instructions

Add scallions, garlic, ginger, chili flakes, sesame seeds,
and sesame oil to a heat-safe bowl with plenty of room left
to add more ingredients. Heat neutral oil over medium-high
heat in a small saucepan until hot, about 5 minutes. Pour
hot oil carefully over green onion mixture. It will bubble
up, so pour slowly. Once the bubbling stops, stir the
mixture and allow to cool slightly. Stir in soy sauce,
oyster sauce and vinegar. Transfer mixture to a jar or
container with a tight fitting lid and refrigerate until
ready to use.
