Chicken Tots


Ingredients
cooking spray
1 (1 pound) bag tater tots
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup red onion
1 cup bell pepper
1/4 cup jalapeno pepper
3 cloves garlic.
1/4 cup green onions
1 lemon, zested
1/2 lemon
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 cup cream
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
sheet pan with foil, and spray with cooking spray. Place
tater tots on the prepared sheet pan, and spray tots lightly
with vegetable oil. Bake in the preheated oven until nicely
browned on the bottoms and edges, about 30 minutes. Keep
warm in the oven until needed. Meanwhile, for chicken,
season chicken thighs on both sides with salt, black pepper,
and cayenne. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat,
and cook chicken just until no longer pink at the center, 3
to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate to cool slightly.
When cool enough to handle, cut chicken into 1/2-inch
pieces. Add onion, bell pepper, and jalapeno peppers to the
skillet, and saut√© over medium-high heat until edges start
to brown and onions turn translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add
garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add sliced green
onions and lemon zest, and toss to combine. Add lemon juice,
chicken broth, and any accumulated juices from the plate,
and cook, stirring, until liquids reduce by about half,
about 5 minutes. Add cream, and bring back to a simmer. Stir
in chicken, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until
chicken is heated through and cream sauce thickens to
desired texture, about 5 minutes more. Turn off heat and
stir in cheese. Serve over hot tots.
