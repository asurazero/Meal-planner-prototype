For taco seasoning, add chili powder, garlic powder, onion

tablespoon taco seasoning. Wrap each sweet potato in foil
and place on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven
until fork tender, about 40 minutes. Heat remaining 2
tablespoons olive oil In a skillet over medium heat; add
diced onion, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add
ground beef and 1/4 cup taco seasoning; cook and stir beef
until browned and crumbly, breaking up clumps with a
spatula, and mixing in seasoning as beef cooks, 5 to 7
minutes. Stir in black beans; cook until heated through,
about 2 minutes. In a small bowl stir together cornstarch
and water until smooth. Stir into the meat mixture and
simmer until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with
salt and pepper. To serve, slice potatoes open, and add a
pinch of taco seasoning to the inside of each potato. Spoon
in meat; top with cheese, pico de gallo, jalapeno, sour
cream, cilantro, and more taco seasoning. Serve immediately.
