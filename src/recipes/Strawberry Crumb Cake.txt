Strawberry Crumb Cake


Ingredients
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 ¾ cups white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
¾ cup unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes
1 cup buttermilk
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups hulled and halved strawberries

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a
9-inch square cake pan with enough parchment paper to have
overhang on all sides. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder,
salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl until combined.
Cut in butter until mixture resembles wet sand. Measure out
1 cup of the crumb mixture to use for the topping, and set
aside. Add buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla to remaining
mixture in the bowl. Mix just until there are no dry clumps
of flour remaining. Fold in strawberries. Pour cake batter
into the prepared pan and smooth into an even layer.
Sprinkle 1 cup reserved crumb mixture evenly over the top.
Bake cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted
into the center of the cake comes out with a few moist
crumbs, 60 to 65 minutes. Allow cake to cool completely in
pan before carefully lifting out of the pan using the
parchment overhang. Cut and serve.
