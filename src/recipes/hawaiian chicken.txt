hawaiian chicken


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Heat oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add red onion,
garlic, and ginger; saute until onion has softened and
turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly
oil the grate. Combine chicken, panko, teriyaki sauce, salt,
and pepper in a large bowl. Add cooled onion and mix gently
with your hands until fully incorporated. Create 4 burger
patties. Grill burgers on the preheated grill until cooked
through, 5 to 6 minutes per side, adding provolone slices
towards the end of the cooking time so they can melt. An
instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the
burgers should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Grill pineapple slices alongside the burgers until warm,
about 1 minute per side. While the burgers are cooking,
prepare hamburger buns with a light smear of mayonnaise.
Place cooked burgers on buns and top with pineapple slices
and jalapeno peppers.
