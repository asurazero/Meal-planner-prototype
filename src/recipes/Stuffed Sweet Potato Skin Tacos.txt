Stuffed Sweet Potato Skin Tacos


Ingredients
2 sweet potatoes, about 10 ounces each
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons taco seasoning, divided
1 pound ground beef
2 tablespoons water
taco toppings,

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and line a
sheet pan with foil. Slice each sweet potato in half
lengthwise, and rub cut surfaces and skins with olive oil.
Evenly sprinkle about 1 tablespoon taco seasoning all over
sweet potatoes and place on the prepared pan, cut side down.
Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then turn and
continue roasting until potatoes are fork-tender, about 15
minutes more. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium
heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until
browned and crumbly, breaking up clumps with a spatula, 5 to
8 minutes; drain excess fat. Sprinkle meat with remaining 2
tablespoons taco seasoning mix and stir in water. Simmer
until liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Place roasted
sweet potatoes on a cutting board and scoop out most of the
sweet potato flesh, leaving about 1/4-inch flesh inside the
skins. Cut the sweet potato flesh into bite-sized pieces and
stir into the ground beef mixture. Fill each sweet potato
shell with beef and sweet potato mixture, gently pressing to
fill. Place filled sweet potato skins on a serving plate and
top with taco toppings.
