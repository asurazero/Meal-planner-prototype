Amish Beef and Noodles


Ingredients
2 1/2 pounds beef chuck
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 large yellow onions
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon beef bouillon paste
8 cups beef broth,
12 ounces egg noodles
green onions for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Toss beef with salt and pepper until evenly coated. Heat
vegetable oil on high heat in a Dutch oven. Brown the beef
thoroughly on both sides, doing half at a time, and remove
to a bowl. Turn off heat. Add butter to Dutch oven, along
with onions and a pinch of salt. Turn heat to medium-high,
and cook, stirring, until onions turn golden, about 5
minutes. Add flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more.
Add garlic powder, beef base, and beef broth. Stir, and wait
for broth to come to a boil. Add reserved beef back in.
Stir, and cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until meat
is very tender, about 2 hours. Use a strainer to remove beef
to a bowl and reserve. Bring both to a boil on high heat,
and add noodles. Cook, stirring, until the noodles are
almost tender (about 30-60 seconds less than package
directions. Stir in beef and reduce heat to low. Once
noodles are tender and beef is heated through, taste and
adjust seasoning. Serve immediately topped with more freshly
ground black pepper and green onions.
