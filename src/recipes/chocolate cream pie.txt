chocolate cream pie


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Combine flour, butter, and salt in a food processor. Pulse
until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 (1-second)
pulses. Stir ice water and vinegar in a small bowl. Pour 1/2
of the ice water mixture into flour mixture; pulse to
combine, about 3 (1-second) pulses. Pour in remaining ice
water mixture; pulse until mixture starts to come together,
about 8 (1-second) pulses. Turn dough out onto a wooden
surface, pat it into a circle, and divide it in half. Form
each half into a disc, about 5-inches wide. Wrap each disc
in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes
until ready to use. Use in your favorite pie recipe.
