Overnight Breakfast Casserole


Ingredients
cooking spray
1/2 (32 ounce) package hash brown potatoes
1 pound pork sausage
1 red bell pepper
1 yellow bell pepper
1/2 cup onion
2 cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
4 cups fresh spinach
4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
12 large eggs
2/3 cup whole milk
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Grease a 9x13 baking dish with
cooking spray. Spread hash browns in the prepared baking
dish. Cook sausage over medium heat in a large skillet until
starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add bell peppers, onion,
garlic, and oregano to skillet. Continue cooking until
vegetables are tender and sausage is no longer pink, about 5
minutes. Add spinach; cook until wilted, about 1 minute.
Spread vegetable and sausage mixture over hash browns in the
baking dish. Sprinkle cheese over the top. Beat eggs, milk,
mustard, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour egg
mixture over casserole. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to
overnight. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees
C). Bake casserole, uncovered, in the preheated oven until a
knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 60
minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
