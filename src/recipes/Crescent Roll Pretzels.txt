Crescent Roll Pretzels


Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent roll dough (such as Pillsbury®
8 cups water
3 tablespoons baking soda
1 small egg
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon butter, melted
¼ teaspoon coarse salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Combine 8
cups water and baking soda in a large pot and bring to a
rolling boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat and
keep water at a simmer. Start at the large end and roll each
crescent roll triangle into a large rope, about 12 inches
long. Form rope into the shape of a pretzel. Using a spider
strainer, lower 1 pretzel at a time into the simmering water
for 7 to 8 seconds. Place pretzels on parchment lined baking
sheet. Combine egg and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl.
Brush each pretzel with egg mixture. Bake in the preheated
oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove from oven.
Brush each pretzel with melted butter and sprinkle with
coarse salt while still hot.
