Charred Cabbage Ginger and Sesame Slaw


Ingredients
1 red cabbage (about 2 pounds)
1 lime, halved
6 green onions
1 piece) fresh ginger, unpeeled
2 carrots, peeled and coarsely shredded
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 teaspoons honey or agave syrup
2 teaspoons riracha
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons sesame seeds, toasted
chopped, unsalted roasted peanuts, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat (350 degrees F to
375 degrees F/175 degrees C to 190 degrees C) . Remove any
wilted outer leaves from cabbage, then cut the head into
quarters. Lightly oil grill grates. Arrange cabbage and
lime, cut sides down, along with green onions and ginger, on
grill grates and cover. Grill green onions and lime, turning
halfway through, until charred, 2 to 4 minutes for onions
and 6 to 8 minutes for lime. Grill cabbage and ginger,
turning halfway through, until cabbage is charred and ginger
is softened, 12 to 16 minutes. When cool enough to handle,
core and shred cabbage. Chop green onions, discarding any
completely charred parts. Toss together carrots, cabbage,
and green onions in a large bowl. Peel and grate 1
tablespoon ginger (save any remaining ginger for another
use). In a small bowl, whisk together ginger, juice from
grilled lime, vegetable oil, vinegar, honey, sriracha,
sesame oil, garlic, crushed red pepper, and salt. Add to
cabbage mixture and toss to combine. Cover and chill 1 hour
before serving, or up to 1 week. Just before serving, add
sesame seeds; toss to combine. Garnish with peanuts.
