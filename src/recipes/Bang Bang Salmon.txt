Bang Bang Salmon


Ingredients
2 (8 ounce) salmon filets
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce
1 teaspoon chile garlic sauce, such as SrirachaÂ®
1 small cucumber, chopped
1 avocado,
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon lime juice

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment
paper. Place salmon filets on the prepared baking sheet and
sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon salt. Whisk mayonnaise, sweet
chili sauce, and Sriracha (R) together in a small bowl.
Spoon half of sauce over filets; reserve remaining sauce for
serving. Bake salmon in the preheated oven for 8 minutes.
Turn broiler on High and broil until fish flakes easily with
a fork, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, for salad, combine
cucumber, avocado, cilantro, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and lime
juice in a separate bowl. Drizzle reserved sauce over
salmon, and serve with cucumber salad.
