Garlic Butter Steak Bites With Mushrooms


Ingredients
1/4 cup coconut aminos or light soy sauce
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 pounds sirloin
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup onion slices
1 tablespoon parsley

Cooking Instructions

Combine coconut aminos, red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon olive
oil, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag.
Seal the bag and gently squeeze ingredients to mix. Add
steak pieces to marinade, squeeze the air out, and seal.
Gently move steak pieces around inside the bag to coat with
marinade. Refrigerate at least 15 to 20 minutes, but no
longer than 1 hour. Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in
a microwave-safe dish, stir in minced garlic, and set aside.
Drain marinade from steak pieces and gently blot with paper
towels. Heat remaining butter over medium-high heat in a
large skillet. When butter is sizzling, add steak pieces in
a single layer and sear until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per
side. Brown in 2 batches, if needed. Remove steak from
skillet to a plate and tent with foil; set aside to rest.
Add mushrooms and onions to the same skillet. Stir
frequently until mushrooms and onions begin to pick up some
color, about 2 minutes. Add about 2 tablespoons water, if
skillet seems dry, and turn heat down to medium. Add garlic
butter to the skillet, and cook until vegetables are tender,
about 3 to 5 minutes more. Stir in steak pieces and any
accumulated juices, and coat with garlic butter in the
skillet. Sprinkle parsley over skillet and remove from heat.
Garnish with additional fresh parsley sprigs, if desired.
