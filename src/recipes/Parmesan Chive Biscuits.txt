Parmesan Chive Biscuits


Ingredients
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chives
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/3 cup sour cream
1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon milk
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted,

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper. In a bowl, whisk together
flour, Parmesan, chives, baking powder, salt, baking soda,
and pepper. Stir in sour cream until the mixture resembles
coarse grains. Add milk and fold until it just comes
together. Scoop the batter by the 1/4 cup using a cookie
scoop or an ice cream scoop onto the prepared baking sheet,
1 inch apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
Remove and brush with melted butter. Bake until golden
brown, 5 to 7 minutes more.
