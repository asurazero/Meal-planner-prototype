Easy Pot Roast


Ingredients
4 pounds chuck roast
4 teaspoons kosher salt
2 1/2 teaspoons pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons oil
1 onion
2 stalks celery, chopped
4 carrots
2 tablespoons butter
2 1/2 tablespoons flour
2 cups water
2 teaspoons beef bouillon paste
1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Season
roast on both sides with 1 tablespoon salt, 2 teaspoons
pepper, and garlic powder. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven
over high heat. When oil begins to shimmer, place roast in
pot and let cook, undisturbed, until browned, about 4
minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side until browned.
Brown on all sides, remove roast from pot, and set aside.
Add onion, celery, and carrots to drippings in the pan.
Season with remaining salt and pepper and cook, stirring
often, until onion begins to soften. Add butter to pot and
allow it to melt. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly,
about 1 minute. Add remaining ingredients and stir, using a
spoon to scrape browned bits from bottom of pot. Return
roast to pan, along with any accumulated juices. Bring to a
simmer, cover, and remove from heat. Bake pot roast in the
preheated oven and cook until roast is tender, about 2 1/2
hours. Allow to rest 10 minutes before shredding and serving
with vegetables and gravy.
