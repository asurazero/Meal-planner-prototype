Baked Burger Dogs


Ingredients
2 tablespoons melted butter or oil
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/3 cup red onion
1/3 cup diced dill or sweet pickles, well drained
6 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded, divided
8 hot dog buns

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a
large 15x10-inch casserole dish with 1 tablespoon melted
butter or oil. Add beef, salt, black pepper, garlic powder,
red onion, pickles, and 4 ounces shredded cheese to a bowl,
and use a fork to mix until all ingredients are evenly
combined. Divide beef mixture into 8 equal portions. Using
damp fingers, shape 1 portion into a log and gently press
onto the bottom of a hot dog bun. Lightly press bun
together, trapping the meat, and place stuffed bun in the
baking dish with meat facing straight up. Repeat until all 8
buns are stuffed. Brush all exposed areas of buns with
remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter or oil, and sprinkle
over remaining 2 ounces of cheese. Bake in the preheated
oven until meat is no longer pink at the center, and buns
are golden brown and crispy on the edges, about 25 minutes.
An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should
read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve immediately with
classic burger and hot dog toppings and condiments.
