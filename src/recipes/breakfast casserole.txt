Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Line the bottom of
the prepared baking dish with 1/2 of the bread cubes.
Sprinkle with ham, Cheddar cheese, and Swiss cheese, and top
with remaining bread. Beat together eggs, milk, and onion
powder in a large bowl. Pour evenly over bread. Cover and
refrigerate overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
(190 degrees C). Blend crushed cornflakes and melted butter
in a small bowl. Spread evenly over casserole. Bake in the
preheated oven until bubbly and golden brown, about 40
minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
