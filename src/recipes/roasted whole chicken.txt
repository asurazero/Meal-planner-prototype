roasted whole chicken


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt
butter with olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high
heat. Add chicken to the Dutch oven and brown on all sides
in butter and oil, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken to a
cutting board. Drain all but 2 tablespoons of liquid from
the pot; stir garlic cloves into the reserved liquid. Return
chicken to the pot; sprinkle water, lemon juice, salt,
thyme, and black pepper over the chicken; cover tightly.
Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at
the bone and the juices run clear, about 90 minutes. An
instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of
the thigh should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove
chicken from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of
aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10
minutes before slicing.
