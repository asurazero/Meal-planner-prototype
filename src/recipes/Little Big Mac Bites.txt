Little Big Mac Bites


Ingredients
1 pound ground sirloin
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons orcestershire sauce
1 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
1 tablespoon sweet relish
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon paprika
2 teaspoons vinegar
1 teaspoon sugar
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup white onion
24 dill pickle slices
1 tablespoon

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly
grease a 24 cup mini muffin pan with cooking spray. Heat a
large, nonstick skillet over medium over medium high heat.
Add ground sirloin and cook, crumbling with a wooden spoon
and stirring often until evenly browned, about 5 minutes.
Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper, garlic powder
and Worcestershire sauce. Cook for 1 minute, then remove
from heat and set aside. Stir together mayonnaise, mustard,
relish, onion powder, paprika, vinegar, sugar and remaining
salt and pepper in a bowl until combined. Refrigerate
dipping sauce until ready to serve. Place about 1 tablespoon
of cheese in the bottom of each muffin cup, working it
against the sides if possible. Divide meat mixture evenly
among the muffin cups and top evenly with onion. Add a slice
of pickle to each cup and top with remaining cheese.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake in the preheated oven until
the cheese begins to brown around the edges, 15 to 20
minutes. Allow to set up in the pan 3 to 5 minutes and
remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Top with more sesame
seeds if desired and serve with big mac dipping sauce.
