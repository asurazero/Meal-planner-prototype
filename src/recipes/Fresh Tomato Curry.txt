Fresh Tomato Curry


Ingredients
4 thin-cut pork chops
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne
1 tablespoon avocado oil
3/4 cup diced yellow onion
2 tablespoons jalapeno pepper
1 tablespoon ginger
3 cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
2 cups fresh tomatoes
1 teaspoon tamarind paste
1/3 cup water
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
1/4 cup red onion
1/4 cup salted cashews
1/4 cup cilantro leaves

Cooking Instructions

Use scissors to snip 4 or 5 small cuts around the edge of
each chop to prevent curling. Season chops on both sides
with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Add oil to a nonstick
skillet over high heat, and sear pork chops on both sides
until lightly browned, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Remove
meat to a plate, and reduce heat to medium. Add onions,
jalapeno, ginger, garlic, and the 1/2 teaspoon salt to the
pan. Cook, stirring, until onions start to turn translucent,
3 to 5 minutes. Add garam masala, cumin, and turmeric and
cook, stirring, until spices are fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add tomatoes and tamarind, and stir everything together. Add
water; simmer until tomatoes completely soften and collapse,
about 10 minutes. Place a mesh strainer over a bowl, and
pour in the tomato mixture. Press and scrape with the back
of a spoon or ladle until only the tomato seeds and skins
remain in the strainer. Transfer the strained sauce back
into the pan, and add the meat, and any accumulated juices
back in. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat; then
reduce heat to maintain a low simmer, and cook until meat is
tender, about 5 minutes. Taste sauce for seasoning, and if
desired, serve topped with yogurt, red onion, cashews, and
cilantro leaves.
