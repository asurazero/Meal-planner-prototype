Dubai Chocolate Berry Trifle


Ingredients
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup kataifi (shredded phyllo dough)
1 cup pistachio cream
2 tablespoons tahini
2 cups milk chocolate chips
1 tablespoon coconut oi
2 quarts strawberries
1 cup raspberries
1 cup blueberries
1 cup blackberries

Cooking Instructions

Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add kataifi and
cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Set aside. Whisk pistachio cream and tahini together in a
bowl until well combined. Set aside. Add chocolate chips to
the bowl of a double boiler set over medium heat. Cook,
stirring constantly, until chocolate is melted and smooth.
Stir in coconut oil and turn off heat; keep warm. Arrange
the trifle just before serving to ensure the chocolate stays
loose. In a trifle bowl or medium serving bowl, add half of
melted chocolate. Top with half of strawberries, half of
raspberries, half of blueberries, and half of blackberries.
Top with half of pistachio cream mixture. Sprinkle with 3/4
cup toasted kataifi. Add remaining berries and remaining
pistachio cream, and top with remaining chocolate. Sprinkle
over remaining kataifi and serve immediately.
