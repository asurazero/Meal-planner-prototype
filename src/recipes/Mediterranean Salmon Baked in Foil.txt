Ingredients
4 12x16-inch) rectangles aluminum foil
4 (6 to 8 ounce) salmon filets
3 tablespoons olive oil,
1 teaspoon Greek seasoning
1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes
4 marinated artichoke hearts
3 tablespoons red onion
3 tablespoons pitted Kalamata olives
1/2 lemon, zested and juiced
2 tablespoons resh parsley
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 cloves garlic,
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 lemon,

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush the
center of each foil rectangle with a small amount of olive
oil. Place a salmon filet in the center of each foil sheet.
Brush filets lightly with olive oil; sprinkle with Greek
seasoning. In a small bowl, combine tomatoes, artichokes,
onion, olives, lemon zest and juice, minced parsley,
balsamic vinegar, garlic, red pepper flakes, and 1
tablespoon olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Spoon tomato mixture evenly over filets. Pull the long ends
of foil rectangles over filets and fold twice to crimp, with
the foil not touching the contents. Lift each end of the
packet and pinch closed. Place packets on a rimmed baking
sheet. Bake in the center of the preheated oven for 12 to 15
minutes. An instant read thermometer, inserted into the
center of filets through the foil packet, should read 145
degrees F (63 degrees C). To serve, place foil packs on
serving plates. Open packets, drizzle with any remaining
olive oil, garnish with parsley sprigs, and serve with lemon
wedges.
