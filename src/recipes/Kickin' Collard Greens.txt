Kickin' Collard Greens


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 slices bacon
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound fresh collard greens, cut into 2-inch pieces
3 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 pinch red pepper flakes

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Heat oil in a large pot over medium-
high heat. Add bacon, and cook until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.
Remove bacon from pan, crumble, and return to the pan. Add
onion to the pan and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add
garlic, and cook until just fragrant. Add collard greens,
and fry until they start to wilt. Pour in chicken broth and
season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Reduce heat
to low, cover, and simmer until greens are tender, about 45
minutes. Serve hot and enjoy!
