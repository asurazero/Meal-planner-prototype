Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Cook and stir flour in a large, heavy pot over medium-low
heat until flour turns golden brown, about 15 minutes. Pour
browned flour into a bowl and return pot to heat. Increase
heat to medium and add oil to the pot. Cook and stir onions
and bell peppers in hot oil until slightly softened, about 7
minutes. Stir garlic, thyme, and bay leaves into onion
mixture; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add sausage to onion
mixture and cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10
minutes. Stir diced tomatoes with juice, shredded chicken,
chicken broth, vegetable juice cocktail, browned flour, and
Creole seasoning into sausage mixture. Bring to a boil,
reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer, stirring
often, until mixture is hot and flavors blend, 20 to 30
minutes. Pour shrimp into sausage-chicken mixture; bring to
a simmer. Cook shrimp until they are pink on the outside and
the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5
minutes. Discard bay leaves. Season gumbo with salt and
pepper to taste.
