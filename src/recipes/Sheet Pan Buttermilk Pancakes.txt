Sheet Pan Buttermilk Pancakes


Ingredients
cooking spray
3 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick®)
2 cups buttermilk
4 large eggs
¼ cup granulated sugar
½ teaspoon vanilla extract
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a
sheet pan (approx. 13 x18 inches) or jelly roll pan (12x17
inches) with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper with
cooking spray. Combine baking mix, buttermilk, eggs, sugar,
vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl. Mix
until the ingredients are well combined, but don't overmix.
Pour batter onto the parchment paper-lined pan. Bake in the
preheated oven until lightly golden, 15 to 18 minutes.
Remove sheet pan from the oven. Lift the parchment paper
with the pancake from the pan and set it onto a cutting
board. Slice the pancake sheet into squares using a pizza
cutter or into your desired shapes with a cookie cutter.
