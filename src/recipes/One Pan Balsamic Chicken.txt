One Pan Balsamic Chicken


Ingredients
2 chicken breasts
1/2 teaspoon herbs
1/4 teaspoon garlic granules
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
8 ounces fresh mozzarella, sliced
1 cup orzo
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
basil leaves, very thinly sliced
1 tablespoon balsamic glaze, or as needed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Slice
chicken breasts in half horizontally to create 4 thin
chicken breasts. Stir Cantazaro herbs, garlic granules,
onion powder, salt, and black pepper together in a small
bowl; season chicken on all sides with mixture. Pour olive
oil into a deep cast iron skillet or other ovenproof skillet
and place over medium-high heat until oil is hot. Add
chicken and sear until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Turn
off heat; remove chicken to a plate. Pour orzo into the
skillet; add chicken broth and balsamic vinegar. Add chicken
back to the skillet along with any accumulated juices.
Scatter cherry tomatoes around, and top chicken with slices
of fresh mozzarella. Bake in the preheated oven until an
instant read thermometer, inserted near the center of
chicken, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 20
minutes. If needed, turn on the ovenâ€™s broiler and broil
until cheese is golden, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with basil
and drizzle with balsamic glaze to taste.
