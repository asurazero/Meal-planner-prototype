Gingerbread Fudge


Ingredients
2 (11-ounce) packages white chocolate chips
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/4 cup molasses
1 tablespoon butter
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with
aluminum foil and lightly grease or butter the foil; set
aside. Set aside 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. Combine
remaining white chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk,
molasses, and butter in a saucepan set over medium heat.
Stir frequently until butter and chocolate chips are
completely melted and ingredients are combined. Add vanilla
extract, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves and
salt; stir well to combine. Pour mixture into the prepared
pan and smooth out evenly. Working quickly, microwave the
remaining 1/2 cup white chocolate chips in a small
microwave-safe bowl until melted, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes,
stirring every 30 seconds. Spoon dollops of the white
chocolate mixture atop the fudge and use a knife to gently
swirl the 2 mixtures together. Cover and chill about 2 hours
or until firm. Use foil to lift uncut fudge out of the pan;
cut into 1-inch squares. Makes 2 pounds 6 ounces.
