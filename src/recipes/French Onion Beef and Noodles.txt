simmer, covered, 25 to 30 minutes or until meat is tender
Whisk together sour cream and Parmesan cheese in a small

pot and stir to combine. Add egg noodles to the pot. Cover
and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes or until
noodles and beef are tender. Top servings with French-fried
onions and parsley.
