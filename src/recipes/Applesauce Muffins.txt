Applesauce Muffins


Ingredients
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons chopped walnuts
1/2 cup milk
1 large egg
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup applesauce
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a
6-cup jumbo muffin pan with liners or grease with butter.
For crumb topping, add butter, flour, brown sugar, and
walnuts to a small bowl. Use a fork to combine until mixture
is small crumbles. Set aside. For muffins, whisk milk, eggs,
and butter together in a bowl. Add brown sugar, applesauce,
and vanilla. Whisk until blended. Set aside. In a separate
bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon,
cloves, and nutmeg. Add the dry mixture to the wet
ingredients and carefully fold in just until combined. Fill
each muffin tin about 2/3 full with batter and sprinkle
evenly with crumb topping. Bake in the preheated oven just
until a toothpick comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Remove
muffins from the pan to cool on a rack.
