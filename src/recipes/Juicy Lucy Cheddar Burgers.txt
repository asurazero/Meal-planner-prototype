Juicy Lucy Cheddar Burgers


Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds ground round
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
6 slices Cheddar cheese
4 burger buns, toasted
onion slices,

Cooking Instructions

Combine ground beef, Worcestershire, salt, pepper, and
garlic powder in a bowl. Mix meat mixture gently to combine
and shape into 8 patties. Stack quartered cheese slices, 6
pieces per burger, onto the center of 4 of the burger
patties. Top each burger with a second patty and pinch the
edges to seal the burger tightly. Preheat an outdoor grill
for medium-high heat. Cook burgers undisturbed on one side
for 4 minutes, or until grill marks appear and burger
releases easily from the grill. Flip and continue to cook
until burger has puffed in the center slightly and is
browned on the other side. Serve burgers on toasted buns
with desired toppings.
