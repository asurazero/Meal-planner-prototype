Lemon Curd-Poppy Seed Crumb Bars


Ingredients
3/4 cup unsalted butter
1 cup light brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
3/4 cup lemon curd
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 large egg, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a
9x9-inch pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang
all sides. In a large bowl, mix together melted butter,
brown sugar, vanilla, salt, and almond extract until
thoroughly combined. Add in flour, baking powder, and poppy
seeds and mix until combined. Measure out about 1 1/2 cups
of the mixture and press evenly into the bottom of the
prepared pan. Reserve remaining mixture to use as the crumb
topping. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is just
beginning to turn golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Meanwhile,
prepare the filling. Mix lemon curd, lemon zest, flour, egg,
vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl with a whisk or
electric mixer until thoroughly combined. Pour in sweetened
condensed milk and mix until combined. Remove crust from
oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Pour filling over
crust and smooth into an even layer using a spatula.
Sprinkle reserved crumbs evenly over filling. Bake until
bars look set, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow bars to cool
completely in the pan. Place bars into the refrigerator
until chilled, at least 4 hours. Cut into 16 bars before
serving.
