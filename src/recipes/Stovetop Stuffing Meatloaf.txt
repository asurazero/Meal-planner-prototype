Stovetop Stuffing Meatloaf


Ingredients
cooking spray
1 1/2 pounds 80/20 ground beef
1 (6 ounce) box chicken stuffing (such as Stovetop)
1/2 cup water
1 large egg
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 cup ketchup, divided
2 tablespoons light brown sugar

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Line an 8- x 4-inch loaf pan with a double
layer of aluminum foil, leaving a 3-inch overhang on the
long sides. Lightly coat with cooking spray and place on a
baking sheet. Using your hands, mix beef, stuffing mix,
water, egg, salt, poultry seasoning, and 1/2 cup of the
ketchup in a large bowl until evenly combined without
overmixing. Press into the prepared loaf pan on the baking
sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned and
the sides are bubbly, about 35 minutes. While meatloaf
bakes, whisk together brown sugar and remaining 1/2 cup
ketchup in a small bowl until smooth. Remove meatloaf from
the oven and spread ketchup mixture evenly over the top.
Return to the oven and continue baking at 350 degrees F (175
degrees C) until an instant-read thermometer inserted into
the thickest portion of meatloaf registers 160 degrees F (71
degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to
rest for 5 minutes. Remove meatloaf from loaf pan using foil
overhang as handles, and transfer to a cutting board. Cut
into 8 slices.
