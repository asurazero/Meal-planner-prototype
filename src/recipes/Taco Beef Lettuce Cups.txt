Taco Beef Lettuce Cups


Ingredients
1 tablespoon avocado oil or other vegetable oil
1 bunch green onions
1 pound lean ground beef
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons cumin
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon oregano, preferably Mexican oregano
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1/4 cup ketchup
1/2 cup water
12 butter lettuce leaves
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup red onion
1/2 cup tomato

Cooking Instructions

Add oil to a nonstick skillet, and place over high heat. Add
white and light green parts of sliced green onion; reserve
the darker green part for garnish. Add beef, and use a
spatula to break into small crumbles, about 5 minutes.
Reduce the heat to medium-high. Add salt, black pepper,
garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, oregano, tomato paste,
and ketchup and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Use a
spatula to smooth and pat the mixture down into an even
layer. Let cook without stirring for 1 to 2 minutes more, or
until the pieces of meat start to form a brown crust. Give
the mixture a stir and repeat the browning process once
more. Add in the water, and continue to cook, stirring
occasionally, until the meat mixture reaches your desired
texture, 1 to 2 more minutesâ€”cook briefly for a saucier
version, or longer for a dryer, stickier version. More
liquid can always be added to the pan to adjust if needed.
Taste for seasoning, and adjust if needed. To serve, spoon
beef into lettuce cups, and garnish with grated cheese, red
onion, and tomato. Finish by sprinkling with reserved dark
green onion tops.
