Cinnamon Streusel Coffee Cake


Ingredients
¾ cup brown sugar
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
½ cup unsalted butter, softened
3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
1 ½ cups white sugar
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
3 large eggs
¾ cup milk
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease a 9x13-inch baking dish; set aside. To make the
cinnamon layer: Stir brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon
together in a small bowl until well combined; set aside. To
make the streusel topping: combine brown sugar, flour,
cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl. Add butter and stir with
a fork until mixture is crumbly; set aside. To make the
cake: Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a
medium bowl. Beat sugar and butter in a stand mixer fitted
with the paddle attachment on medium speed until fluffy,
about 3 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl, then turn the
mixer on low speed and beat in eggs until well blended.
Gradually mix in flour mixture and milk. Add sour cream and
vanilla and beat for 30 seconds. Pour 1/2 of the batter into
the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the cinnamon layer over
batter, then pour the remaining batter over top. Spread
streusel topping evenly over the cake, pressing very lightly
so it adheres to the batter. Bake in the preheated oven
until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40
to 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely
before serving, about 30 minutes.
