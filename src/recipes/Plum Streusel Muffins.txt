Plum Streusel Muffins


Ingredients
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/3 cup light brown sugar
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 cup white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup 2% milk
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup plums

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease or
line every other muffin cup of a standard 12-cup muffin pan.
For streusel, combine melted butter, brown sugar, flour,
cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl until mixture comes
together and forms crumbs. Set aside. For muffin batter, mix
butter, white sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in
a large bowl until combined. Add in eggs and vanilla and mix
until thoroughly combined. Pour in sour cream and milk and
mix until combined. Add in flour, baking powder, and baking
soda and mix until almost all the way incorporated, with
some dry spots of flour remaining. Add in chopped plums and
fold to incorporate. Fill every other muffin cup of the
prepared pan (so only 6 of the 12 cups) up to the top with
the muffin batter. Crumble streusel topping over the top of
each muffin, reserving enough streusel to bake remaining
batter. Place muffin pan onto a baking sheet. Bake in the
preheated oven until muffins are very tall, golden brown,
and the tops of the muffins spring back when lightly
touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow muffins to cool in the pan
for 5 to 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool
completely. Repeat baking process of preparing every other
muffin cup, filling every other muffin cup up to the top
with batter, topping each with streusel, and baking until
all the batter is used up.
