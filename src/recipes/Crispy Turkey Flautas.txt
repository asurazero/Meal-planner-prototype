Crispy Turkey Flautas


Ingredients
1 pound cooked, shredded turkey
6 ounces shredded pepper Jack cheese
⅓ cup chopped green onions
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
24 small white corn tortillas
1 egg white to seal flautas (Optional)
¾ cup shredded napa cabbage
¾ cup guacamole
¾ cup sour cream
¾ cup salsa
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Mix shredded turkey, pepper Jack cheese, green onions, salt
and pepper together in a bowl. Wrap stack of tortillas in a
paper towel and place in a sealable plastic bag. Seal the
bag only halfway. Microwave on high until tortillas are hot
and flexible, about 45 seconds. Keep tortillas warm in the
bag as you fill the others. Place 2 tortillas on a work
surface, one about 2 inches off center of the first creating
a longer partially double tortilla. Spoon about 1/4 to 1/3
cup turkey mixture in a row just below the center of the
long side of the tortilla. Paint a bit of egg white along
the top edge of the tortillas. Bring bottom edge of the
tortilla up and over the filling and roll rather tightly
toward the top edge over the egg white. Set aside with the
fold on the bottom while you fill the remaining tortillas.
Place 1/4 inch vegetable oil in a saute pan over medium
heat. When oil is hot, place flautas in oil, seam side down.
Press down gently with a spatula a couple of seconds to
flatten bottoms. Fry in batches until flautas are crispy,
golden, and heated through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain
about a minute on paper towels. Serve topped with shredded
cabbage, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and chopped cilantro.
