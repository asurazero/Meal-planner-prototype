Mini Chicken Pot Pies


Ingredients
1 (8 count) packag frozen mini pie shells
1 pie crust
1 3/4 cups frozen mixed vegetables
1/2 cup water
1 (5.3-ounce) package soft French cheese
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 3/4 cups cooked chicken
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste
1 large egg
1 tablespoon water

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
sheet pan with parchment paper, and place individual pie
shells on the sheet. Allow refrigerated pie crust to come to
room temperature on the counter, about 15 minutes. Place
frozen vegetables into a microwave-safe dish, add water,
cover, and microwave on High until hot, about 5 minutes.
Drain. Stir Boursin into vegetables until melted. Stir in
cream, chicken, and black pepper; season with salt.
Distribute mixture evenly among pie shells. Using a 3-inch
round biscuit cutter, cut 8 circles from refrigerated pie
crust. Place a circle on top of each pie and crimp edges
together. Using a sharp knife, cut two slits in the form of
an "X" in the center of each top crust. Stir egg and water
together in a cup until well combined; brush each pie
lightly with egg wash. Bake in the center of the preheated
oven until lightly browned, about 20 to 25 minutes, or until
lightly browned. Remove to cool on a rack about 10 minutes.
Remove foil tins from pies and serve warm.
