Ingredients
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon lemon juice, or more to taste
1 teaspoon garlic
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon milk, or more as needed
4 (6 ounce) cod filets
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter

Cooking Instructions

For lemon aioli: Stir mayonnaise, lemon zest, lemon juice,
and grated garlic together in a small bowl. Season to taste
with salt and pepper. Thin to a drizzling consistency with
milk. For fish: Pat fish dry with a paper towel. Heat olive
oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle
both sides of cod with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.

both sides and fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 4
minutes per side. Transfer to serving plates, and serve with
lemon aioli.
