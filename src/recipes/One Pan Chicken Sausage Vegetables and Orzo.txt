One Pan Chicken Sausage Vegetables and Orzo


Ingredients
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon unsalted butter
1 pound chicken sausage
1 small onion
1 cup sliced mushrooms
2 cloves garlic
1 cup French-sliced green beans
1/2 cup carrots
1/2 cup red bell pepper strips
1/2 cup white wine
2 cups chicken broth
teaspoons Italian herb seasoning blend
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups orzo
1/2 cup artichokes
fresh parsley sprigs, for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Warm olive oil and butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium
heat. When the butter stops sizzling, add sausage pieces.
Cook until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes, then add onion. Cook
together, stirring, about 2 minutes, and add mushrooms. Cook
until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring,
until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in French-sliced
green beans, matchstick carrots, red bell pepper strips, and
continue to cook and stir about 2 minutes. Add wine, and
stir about 1 minute, then add chicken broth and Italian
seasoning blend. Taste; season with salt and pepper.
Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Stir in
orzo, and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and
place artichokes on top. Allow mixture to bubble lightly
until orzo and vegetables are tender and most of liquid is
absorbed, 12 to 14 minutes. Stir occasionally, so orzo does
not stick to the bottom of the pan. Garnish with parsley;
serve warm.
