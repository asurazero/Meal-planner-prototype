Air Fryer Cherry Cream Cheese Croissants


Ingredients
flour for dusting
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent roll dough (such as PillsburyÂ®
1 (8 ounce) tub cream cheese
1 (15 ounce) can pitted sour cherries, drained
cooking spray
ground cinnamon to taste

Cooking Instructions

Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Unroll crescent
dough and divide into triangles along the perforated lines.
Spread each triangle with cream cheese. Drop 3 or 4 cherries
on the wider portion of each crescent dough triangle.
Carefully roll up each crescent, making sure the cherries
stay tucked in. Fold down the ends of each roll slightly so
it forms a crescent shape. Spray the basket of the air fryer
with non stick cooking spray spray. Carefully set the
croissants into the basket. Set air fryer to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C). Air fry croissants until puffed up and
lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Check to make sure
croissants are not sticking to each other and that they are
not overly browned. Continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes
longer, making sure they do not get too done. Transfer
croissants to a plate and sprinkle with cinnamon.
