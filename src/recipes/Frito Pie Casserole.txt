Frito Pie Casserole


Ingredients
1 pound ground chuck
1 cup chopped yellow onion
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 1/4 cups low-sodium chicken stock
1 (15 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 15 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (15 ounce) can sweet whole kernel corn, drained
1 (1 ounce) envelope taco seasoning mix
1 chipotle chile
8 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded, divided
2 1/2 cups corn chips (such as FritosÂ®)
sliced scallions, for garnish
sour cream, guacamole, and salsa, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add ground chuck, and cook, stirring and breaking up meat
into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until browned and
almost cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and bell
pepper; cook, stirring often, until beef is cooked through
and onion is softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in stock,
kidney beans, diced tomatoes, corn, taco seasoning, chipotle
chile and adobo sauce. Bring to a boil over medium-high.
Reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring often, until
slightly thickened, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and
stir in 1 cup of the Cheddar. Transfer beef mixture to a 9 x
13-inch baking dish, and spread in an even layer. Top evenly
with remaining Cheddar, and sprinkle evenly with corn chips.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until mixture is
bubbling and Cheddar cheese is melted and starting to brown,
18 to 20 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes. Garnish with
scallions, and serve with sour cream, guacamole, and salsa.
