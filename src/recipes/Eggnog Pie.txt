Eggnog Pie


Ingredients
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
¼ cup cold water
1 cup milk
½ cup white sugar
2 eggs, lightly beaten
¼ cup rum
1 cup whipping cream
¼ pinch white sugar
1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg

Cooking Instructions

In a small bowl, combine gelatin and cold water; set aside
to soften. Combine milk and 1/2 cup sugar in a small glass
bowl. Microwave for 3 minutes or until milk begins to boil.
In a steady stream, pour hot milk into beaten eggs, whisking
constantly. Cook custard in the microwave, whisking after
each minute, until it thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.
Stir in softened gelatin and mix until melted. Stir in rum.
Let filling cool to room temperature. (If you refrigerate
it, stir occasionally to prevent gelatin from setting too
soon. See Editor's Note.) In a medium bowl, whip cream until
soft peaks form; beat in 1/4 cup sugar. Set aside 1/2 cup of
whipped cream for garnish; keep refrigerated. Fold remaining
whipped cream into eggnog mixture. Pour filling into pie
crust and refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Garnish with
reserved whipped cream and a dusting of nutmeg.
