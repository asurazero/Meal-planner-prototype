Sheet Pan Lemon Balsamic Chicken and Potatoes


Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 1/2 pounds baby potatoes,
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup green olives
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons pepperoncini peppers
1 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon dried dill
1 cup tzatziki sauce
2 ounces feta cheese

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place chicken and
potatoes in a large bowl. Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil, balsamic
vinegar, Dijon mustard, paprika, oregano, garlic, black
pepper, and chili flakes together in a small bowl. Pour
mixture over chicken and potatoes; toss to coat. Arrange
chicken and potatoes on the prepared baking sheet in an even
layer. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken juices run
clear and potatoes are tender, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-
read thermometer inserted near the center of chicken should
read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Meanwhile, for brine,
stir 2 tablespoons olive oil, olives, lemon juice,
pepperoncini, basil, and dill together in a small bowl. Stir
tzatziki sauce and feta together in a separate bowl. Remove
chicken and potatoes from the oven. Divide onto serving
plates. Drizzle with olive brine and top with tzatziki feta
sauce. Serve immediately.
