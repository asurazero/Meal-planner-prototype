Cowboy Spaghetti


Ingredients
6 strips bacon
1 onion
2 cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pound ground beef
1 1/2 cups beef broth
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons hot sauce
8 ounces spaghetti noodles
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire roasted tomatoes
1 (4 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup sharp Cheddar cheese
3 green onions, sliced, or as needed for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Place bacon in a large cast iron skillet and cook over
medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until slightly
crisp, about 7 minutes. Remove bacon slices to a paper
towel-lined plate. When bacon is cool enough to handle,
crumble roughly and set aside. Add onion to the same skillet
with bacon grease and saut√© until softened, about 3 minutes.
Add garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir until garlic is fragrant,
about 30 seconds. Add ground beef. Cook and stir until beef
is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Lower heat
to medium-low, and stir in beef broth, Worcestershire sauce,
and hot sauce. Stir in 1/2 of the crumbled bacon. Break
spaghetti noodles in half. Scatter over ground beef, making
sure noodles are separated. Pour tomatoes with green chiles,
fire-roasted tomatoes, and tomato sauce over noodles. Cover
and cook for 20 minutes. Remove the lid and stir to combine
the pasta and sauce. Smooth out mixture and scatter shredded
cheese evenly over top. Sprinkle with remaining bacon. Cover
and let cheese melt, about 5 minutes. Garnish with green
onions; serve immediately.
