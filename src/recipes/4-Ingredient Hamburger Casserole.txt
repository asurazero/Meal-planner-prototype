4-Ingredient Hamburger Casserole


Ingredients
8 ounces pasta
1 pound ground beef
salt, freshly ground black pepper
10 ounces tomato soup
8 to 10 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese,

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill a
large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling
boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered,
stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
about 10 minutes. Drain pasta, reserving about 2 tablespoons
pasta water. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-
high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet
until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt,
pepper, and garlic powder. Drain and discard grease. Place
ground beef in a large round casserole dish. Add pasta on
top; sprinkle with half the cheese. Pour tomato soup on top;
add reserved pasta water and stir everything together well.
Cover with foil. Bake in the preheated oven, covered, for 15
minutes. Uncover and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Bake,
uncovered, 10 minutes more. Turn on the ovenâ€™s broiler and
set a rack 6 inches from the heat source. Broil casserole
until cheese is browned, about 2 minutes. Remove from the
oven and serve.
