One Pot Turmeric Chicken and Rice


Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast,
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 cup onion
2 teaspoons fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic
1 cup tomato
2 cups green beans
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 pinch ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 cup jasmine rice
2 bay leaves
2 teaspoons fish sauce
1 1/2 cups chicken stock

Cooking Instructions

Pat chicken pieces dry; season with salt and pepper. Melt
butter in a large casserole or Dutch oven, and sprinkle with
turmeric. Add chicken pieces in a single layer and cook over
medium-high heat until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn
and brown the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer chicken
to a plate and keep warm. To the same pot, add onion,
ginger, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until
starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, green
beans, curry powder, cinnamon, cumin, and rice. Stir
constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Return chicken
and any accumulated juices to the pot, and add bay leaves,
fish sauce, and chicken stock. Be sure to stir up all the
browned bits from the bottom of the pot into the sauce.
Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low; simmer for
10 minutes. Meanwhile, make raita, if using (See Cookâ€™s
Note). Adjust the lid to partially cover and vent, and
continue to simmer until rice is tender, 10 to 15 minutes
longer. Remove from heat, uncover, and let stand for 5
minutes. Serve warm, with raita as a garnish, if desired.
