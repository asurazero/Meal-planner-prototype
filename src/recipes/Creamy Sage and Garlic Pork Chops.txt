Creamy Sage and Garlic Pork Chops


Ingredients
4 bone-in rib pork chops
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons sage
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
15 sage leaves
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chicken broth or stock
1/2 cup white wine
3/4 cup heavy cream

Cooking Instructions

Pat chops dry with paper towels and season both sides with
salt, and pepper. Sprinkle both sides of chops with 1
teaspoon rubbed sage, and set aside. Heat olive oil and
butter in a large skillet over medium heat until sizzling.
Add sage leaves in a single layer and cook about 2 minutes.
Turn and continue cooking until the leaves are crispy, about
2 more minutes. Remove to a paper towel to drain, then chop.
Add seasoned chops to the same skillet and brown both sides,
3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chops to a plate. Add minced
garlic to the skillet and cook until fragrant, about 30
seconds. Stir in flour and cook, stirring, until all flour
is moistened with the oil and begins to bubble. Add chicken
broth and stir rapidly until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in
white wine and cook, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in
remaining 1/2 teaspoon rubbed sage. Gradually stir in cream,
and simmer until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. Return
chops to the skillet, and cook in the sauce for an
additional 3 to 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
inserted near the center of chops should read 145 degrees F
(63 degrees C). Sprinkle with chopped fried sage leaves and
serve immediately.
