Boursin Chicken Baked Ziti


Ingredients
1/2 cup pecorino Romano cheese
2 tablespoons breadcrumbs
1/2 pound ziti pasta
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 cup onion
1 clove garlic
1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 cup cooked chicken
1 cup fresh spinach
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 (5.2 ounce) package soft French cheese, such as BoursinÂ® Garlic and Fine Herbs
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and grease
an 8x8-inch baking dish. Combine grated pecorino and
breadcrumbs in a small bowl; set aside. Bring a large pot of
salted water to a boil. Add ziti, and cook until tender with
a bite, about 11 minutes. Drain; reserve about 2 tablespoons
pasta water. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large nonstick
skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion; cook and stir
until onion begins to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in
garlic, herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes, and cook
about 30 seconds. Turn off heat. Stir in chicken, spinach,
cream, Boursin, and mozzarella, stirring until cheeses are
melted and ingredients are well combined. Stir drained ziti
into chicken mixture. Loosen the sauce with reserved pasta
water, if needed. Pour chicken and sauce mixture into the
prepared baking dish. Sprinkle pecorino and bread crumb
mixture over the top. Bake in the center of the preheated
oven until bubbly and lightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.
Serve warm.
