Garlic Butter Chicken Bites


Ingredients
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon grated garlic
1/4 cup white wine
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
chopped parsley

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Whisk together flour, salt, Italian
seasoning, and granulated garlic in a medium bowl until
evenly combined; add chicken and toss until evenly coated.
Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high until
just shimmering. Add coated chicken pieces in an even layer;
cook, undisturbed, until browned on one side, about 4
minutes. Flip chicken and cook until browned and cooked
through, about 4 minutes more. Transfer chicken to a clean
plate; wipe skillet clean. Reduce heat to medium. Add
garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and
slightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in wine and cook,
stirring often, until the majority of the wine has
evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add butter and lemon juice;
cook, stirring, until butter is fully melted, about 1 more
minute. Add chicken back to skillet and toss in butter
mixture until evenly coated. Transfer to a serving platter
and garnish with parsley.
