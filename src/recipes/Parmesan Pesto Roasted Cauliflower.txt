Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower


Ingredients
1 head cauliflower
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1/4 cup pesto
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, toss the
cauliflower florets with olive oil, salt, and pepper until
evenly coated. Spread cauliflower evenly in a single layer
on the prepared baking sheet. Set the bowl aside. Roast in
the preheated oven until golden and crispy on the edges, 25
to 30 minutes, turning halfway through cooking time.
Transfer hot cauliflower back to the bowl and toss with
pesto and Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
