Lemon Crumb Bars


Ingredients
3/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3 large eggs
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons lemon zest
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoons unsalted butter,
1/2 cup lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a
9x9-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have
overhang on all sides. For crust and crumb, stir together
melted butter, white sugar, brown sugar, salt, and vanilla
until thoroughly combined. Add in flour and baking powder
and mix until mixture comes together in large clumps.
Measure out a loosely-packed 1 3/4 cups crumbs and press
firmly and evenly into the bottom of prepared pan. Reserve
remaining crumb mixture for topping. Break an egg into a
large bowl and whisk for a few seconds. Lightly brush a thin
layer of egg over the crust; you will use any egg left in
the filling. Place crust into the freezer for about 10 to 15
minutes while you prepare filling. For filling, to the egg
you used as egg wash, add the remaining 2 eggs, 1 cup plus 2
tablespoons sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest, and pinch salt.
Whisk until completely smooth and combined. Whisk in the 3
tablespoons melted butter until incorporated. Pour in lemon
juice and whisk until combined. Remove crust from freezer
and pour the filling evenly over the top. Bake bars in the
preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove pan from oven and
sprinkle reserved crumb topping evenly over the top,
breaking up any larger crumbs as needed. Return pan to the
oven. Bake until crumbs just begin to turn golden, 20 to 25
minutes more. Allow bars to cool completely, about 30
minutes, before cutting and serving.
