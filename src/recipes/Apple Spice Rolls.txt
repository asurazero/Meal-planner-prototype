Apple Spice Rolls


Ingredients
6 tablespoons butter
2 cups Braeburn or Granny Smith apples -
4 1/4 cups flour, plus more as needed
1 (0.25 ounce) packet dry yeast
1 cup whole milk
1 cup mashed potato
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1 cup packed brown sugar
4 teaspoons apple pie spice or ground cinnamon
2/3 cup heavy cream
3 ounces cream cheese
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice
1 pinch salt
2 1/2 cups confectioners sugar
1 teaspoon whole milk

Cooking Instructions

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium
heat. Cook apples, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5 to
8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl; let cool completely. Stir
together 1 1/2 cups flour and the yeast in the bowl of a
stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Heat 5 tablespoons
butter, the milk, potato, white sugar, and salt in a
saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until just
warm (120 to 130 degrees F (49 to 54 degrees C)) and butter
almost melts. Pour into bowl with flour mixture; add eggs.
Mix at low speed 30 seconds, stopping to scrape bowl as
needed. Beat at high speed 3 minutes. Mix in remaining 2 3/4
cups flour. Knead in stand mixer, adding up to 1/2 cup more
flour as needed to make a soft, elastic, sticky dough, about
3 minutes. Form dough into a ball and put in a large,
lightly greased bowl, turning to coat. Let rise, covered, in
a warm place (75 to 80 degrees F (24 to 27 degrees C)) until
doubled in size, 45 to 60 minutes. Punch dough down. Turn
out onto a lightly floured surface. Let rest, covered, about
10 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking
dish. For filling, stir together brown sugar and apple pie
spice in a small bowl. Uncover dough, then roll into a
12x18-inch rectangle. Spread with remaining 1/3 cup butter.
Sprinkle with filling and apples, leaving a 1-inch border
along one long side. Starting on the end opposite the
border, tightly roll up dough to form a log; pinch seam to
seal. Cut crosswise into 12 equal portions; arrange in
prepared dish. Let rise, covered, in a warm place (75
degrees F to 80 degrees F) until nearly doubled in size, 30
to 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190
degrees C). Pour heavy cream evenly over rolls. Put a very
large foil-lined baking sheet on oven rack under baking dish
to catch drips. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 23
to 28 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, for cream cheese frosting, beat cream cheese,
butter, vanilla, apple pie spice, and salt together in a
bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until combined.
Gradually beat in confectionerâ€™s sugar until smooth. Beat in
enough whole milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, to reach desired
spreading consistency. Spread rolls with cream cheese
frosting; serve warm.
