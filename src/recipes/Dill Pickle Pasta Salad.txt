Dill Pickle Pasta Salad


Ingredients
1 pound bowtie pasta
10 slices bacon
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 cups chopped refrigerated dill pickles
2 tablespoons dill
1 cup sharp Cheddar cheese
2/3 cup mayonnaise
2/3 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon onion powder

Cooking Instructions

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons salt
and pasta to water and cook, stirring often, until pasta is
al dente, 9 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water
just enough to bring the pasta to lukewarm or room
temperature. Drain well. Meanwhile, place bacon in a large
skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain
bacon slices on paper towels. Add pasta to a large bowl.
Reserve 1 tablespoon chopped pickles, 1 teaspoon dill, and 1
tablespoon bacon for garnish. Add cheese and remaining
pickles, dill, and bacon to the pasta bowl. In a separate
bowl, whisk together remaining 2 teaspoons salt with pickle
brine, mayonnaise, sour cream, black pepper, and onion
powder until well combined. Pour mixture over pasta mixture
and toss well to coat. Transfer mixture to a serving bowl
and top with reserved pickles, dill and bacon. Serve
immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve.
