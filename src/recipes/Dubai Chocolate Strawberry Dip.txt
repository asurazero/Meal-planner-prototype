Dubai Chocolate Strawberry Dip


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups whole milk
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups frozen or thawed kataifi
1 (3.9 ounce) package chocolate instant pudding and pie filling
1 cup pistachio cream
3 tablespoons tap water
1/2 cup lightly salted pistachios
1 1/2 tablespoons tahini
1 quart fresh strawberries
flaky sea salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Heat milk in a saucepan over low
until steaming, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk
in chocolate chips until smooth. Pour melted chocolate into
a large shallow bowl. Cover with plastic wrap with wrap
touching the surface of the chocolate mixture. Freeze until
mixture is thickened and chilled, about 30 minutes. While
chocolate mixture chills, melt butter in a nonstick skillet
over medium heat. Add kataifi and cook, stirring
occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, about 6
minutes. Transfer to a bowl; set aside 3 tablespoons for
garnish. Pour chilled chocolate mixture through a fine-mesh
strainer set over a large bowl with instant pudding. Whisk
mixture constantly until slightly thickened and pudding mix
is dissolved, about 4 minutes. Refrigerate until ready to
use. In a separate bowl, stir together pistachio cream and
water until smooth. Gently fold in kataifi, pistachios, and
tahini until combined. Transfer kataifi mixture to a shallow
serving bowl; spread in an even layer. Then, top mixture
with chocolate pudding in an even layer. Garnish with
reserved kataifi, pistachios, and flaky salt, if desired.
Serve with strawberries.
