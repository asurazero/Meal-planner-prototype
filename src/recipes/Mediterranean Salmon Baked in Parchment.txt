Mediterranean Salmon Baked in Parchment


Ingredients
2 (6 to 8-ounce) salmon fillets
2 squares parchment paper
1/4 cup butter, divided
1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
2 tablespoons pecans
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon Greek seasoning
2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
3 ounces portobello mushrooms
6 ounces artichoke hearts
1 pinch black pepper
3/4 cup inot Grigio or other dry white wine
2 ounces roasted bell pepper

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Place
each salmon fillet on a sheet of parchment. Melt 2
tablespoons butter and brush over salmon. Combine panko,
pecans, garlic salt, and 1/2 teaspoon Greek seasoning in a
small bowl and stir together. Evenly sprinkle over salmon
fillets. Crimp and fold parchment around fillets to form a
packet. Place packets on a rimmed baking tray. Bake in the
preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about
25 minutes. Meanwhile, for sauce, heat grapeseed oil in a
skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring,
for about 3 minutes. Stir in artichoke hearts, remaining 1/2
teaspoon Greek seasoning and pepper, and continue to cook
and stir for about 6 minutes. Pour in white wine. Biring to
a simmer and cook until liquid is reduced by half, about 10
minutes. Add roasted bell pepper, and cook, stirring, until
peppers are warmed through, about 1 minute. Stir in
remaining butter to melt, about 1 minute more. Carefully
peel back parchment from salmon and ladle sauce over the
salmon.
