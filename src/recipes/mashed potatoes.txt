mashed potatoes


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C). Place
potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to
a boil, and cook until potatoes are tender, about 10
minutes. Drain, then add cream cheese, butter, sour cream,
and ranch dressing mix. Mash until creamy using a potato
masher or electric mixer. Spread evenly in a large baking
dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden
brown, about 30 minutes.
