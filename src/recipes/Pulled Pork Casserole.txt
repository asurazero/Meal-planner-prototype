Pulled Pork Casserole


Ingredients
1 (12-ounce) pulled pork
2 cups corn, divided
1 (15- black beans or
1 (8-ounce) shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup barbecue sauce
1 (8.5 ounce) package corn bread mix
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 (8-ounce) carton sour cream
1 large egg
pickled onion (see Note) (optional)
coleslaw (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Combine pulled pork, 1 cup corn, beans, 1/2
of the Cheddar cheese, and barbecue sauce in a 9x13-inch
baking dish; stir until evenly mixed. Gently spread in an
even layer. Stir together cornbread mix, remaining 1 cup
corn, remaining Cheddar cheese, melted butter, sour cream,
and egg in a bowl until well combined. Spoon cornbread
mixture over the pulled pork, spreading evenly. Bake in the
preheated oven until golden brown and cornbread is set (it
will be a little moist), 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool 5
minutes before serving. Serve with pickled onion or
coleslaw, if desired.
