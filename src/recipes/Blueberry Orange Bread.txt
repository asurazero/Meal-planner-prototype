Blueberry Orange Bread


Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup unsalted butter
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 orange
1 cup fresh blueberries
1/2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons orange marmalade

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a
9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Add 1 1/2 cups flour,
sugar, baking powder, and salt to a large bowl, and stir
until well combined. Whisk orange juice, butter, eggs, and
orange rind in a small bowl. Pour into the flour mixture,
and stir until just combined. Place blueberries in a small
bowl, sprinkle lightly with the 1/2 tablespoon flour until
coated. Gently fold the blueberries into the batter, and
spoon into the prepared pan. Warm marmalade in the microwave
for about 10 seconds to loosen and spread on top of the
batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes
out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Allow bread to cool for 10
minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
