1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 lemon
1 orange
1 lime,
1/2 cup minced garlic
2 tablespoons adobo seasoning
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2 (.81 ounce) packets Sazon seasoning with coriander and achiote
1 quart oil for frying
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup cornstarch
1 pinch salt
1 pinch black pepper

Cooking Instructions

Combine chicken, lemon juice and zest, orange juice and
zest, lime juice and zest, minced garlic, adobo seasoning,
onion powder, black pepper, coriander, and Sazon seasoning
in a large bowl; stir. Cover and marinate in the
refrigerator for 4 hours. Heat oil in a large pot over
medium heat to about 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place

golden brown and crunchy, 5 to 10 minutes. An instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
