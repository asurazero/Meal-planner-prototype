Leftover Roast Chicken Coconut Soup


Ingredients
1 roast chicken carcass
8 cups water
1/2 large onion
2 stalks celery
parsley stems (optional)
1 chicken bouillon cube or 2 teaspoons chicken bouillon paste
1 tablespoon coconut oil
2 tablespoons ginger
1 bunch green onions
1 teaspoon kosher salt
8 ounces portobello mushrooms
1/2 cup grated carrots
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 can unsweetened coconut milk
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon riracha
1 1/2 cups cooked rice

Cooking Instructions

Place chicken in a large stock pot and add cold water,
onions, celery, and parsley stems. Bring to a boil over high
heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 1 hour. Strain
and reserve liquid. Separate any remaining chicken meat from
the carcass and reserve. Discard remaining ingredients in
the strainer. Stir bouillon into hot broth until dissolved.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add white and
light green parts of onion, along with the ginger, and cook
until fragrant, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon
salt and stir. Add mushrooms and cook until lightly browned,
about 3 minutes. Add carrots and remaining salt and cook 3
minutes, stirring often. Add pepper, garlic powder and 6
cups of reserved broth. Stir, scraping up any browned bits
from the bottom of the pot. Add in coconut milk and reserved
chicken pieces and bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.
Add remaining green onions, lime juice, and Sriracha. Serve
topped with 1/4 cup of rice per serving.
