Rose Petal Pound Cake


Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, room temperature
1 ⅔ cups white sugar
5 eggs, room temperature
1 teaspoon almond extract
3 tablespoons ground almonds
1 teaspoon rosewater
2 drops red food coloring
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, for dusting

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one
9-inch tube pan. Sift together flour and salt; set aside.
Beat butter in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy; it
should be noticeably lighter in color. In a separate bowl,
beat sugar and eggs together until doubled in volume.
Mixture should be thick and lemon-colored. Add sifted flour
and salt gradually to the egg mixture, mixing until fully
combined. Fold in creamed butter and mix thoroughly. Divide
batter into two equal parts. Into one part, add the almond
extract and the ground almonds. To the other part, add the
rosewater and the red food coloring. Spoon batters
alternately into the prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven
until a cake tester comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Let
cake cool for 15 minutes; then remove from pan to cool
completely. Dust with confectioner's sugar before serving.
