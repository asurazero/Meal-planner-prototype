Beef Birria Queso Tacos with Consommé


Ingredients
2 cups reserved sauce from beef birria recipe
1 cup chicken broth
Â¼ cup diced carrots
Â¼ cup diced celery
Â½ cup diced cabbage
3 tablespoons reserved beef fat from beef birria recipe, or more as needed
8 (5 inch) corn tortillas
2 cups freshly grated Monterey Jack cheese
2 cups shredded Beef Birria
4 tablespoons chopped white onion, or to taste, divided
4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste, divided
1 medium lime, cut into 4 wedges

Cooking Instructions

To make the consommÃ©: Stir beef birria sauce, chicken broth,
carrots, celery, and cabbage together in a saucepan over
high heat. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to
medium-low and simmer, occasionally brushing the caramelized
bits (fond) off the side with the hot liquid, until
vegetables are nice and tender and consommÃ© has reached the
desired consistency, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to
low and keep hot while you prepare the tacos. To make the
tacos: Heat some reserved beef fat in a large skillet over
medium heat until melted. Add two tortillas and flip with a
spatula until generously coated in fat. Toast briefly until
golden brown, then cover with Monterey Jack cheese and some
shredded beef. Drizzle each taco with about 1 tablespoon
consommÃ© liquid, then top with some white onion and
cilantro. Fold tacos in half and press gently. Continue to
cook, flipping back and forth, until browned and crispy, 2
to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat to make
remaining tacos, adding more fat if necessary. Ladle
consommÃ© into a bowl and garnish with any remaining white
onion and cilantro. Squeeze lime wedges into consommÃ© and
serve with tacos.
