Cornbread Salad


Ingredients
cooking spray
1 (16 ounce) package corn bread mix
1 ½ cups water
10 slices bacon
1 ½ cups sour cream
1 ½ cups mayonnaise
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, drained
3 tomatoes, chopped
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 cup chopped green onion
2 (11 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Cooking Instructions

Make the cornbread: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190
degrees C). Spray the bottom and sides of an 8x8-inch pan
with cooking spray. Combine cornbread mix and water in a
large mixing bowl until smooth; pour into prepared pan. Bake
in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool; crumble
and set aside. Meanwhile, make the salad: Place bacon in a
large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain
bacon slices on paper towels. Whisk sour cream, mayonnaise,
and dressing mix together in a medium bowl. Crumble 1/2 of
the cornbread in the bottom of a large serving dish. Evenly
layer with 1 can of pinto beans, 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2
cup green bell pepper, 1/2 cup green onions, 1 can of corn,
1 cup of cheese, 1/2 of the bacon, and 1/2 of the sour cream
mixture. Repeat the layers. Cover and chill for at least 2
hours before serving.
