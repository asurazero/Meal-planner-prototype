Pickle Crustburger


Ingredients
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 teaspoon mustard
2 teaspoons ketchup
2 teaspoons pickle juice
1/2 tablespoon butter
1 potato hamburger bun
1/4 pound ground beef
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3 pickle slices
1 slice American cheese

Cooking Instructions

Stir mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, and pickle juice together
in a small bowl until well blended; set aside. Heat a large
skillet over medium-high heat. Spread butter on the outside
of the top and bottom bun halves; place bun halves buttered
sides down in the skillet and press to flatten. Cook, until
toasted, about 1 minute. Flip bun and toast on the other
side, about 30 seconds, continuing to press to flatten.
Place bun on a work surface with cut sides facing down.
Spread desired amount of sauce over buns. Divide meat into 2
balled portions and place in a hot skillet. Using 2
spatulas, flatten meat to form a very thin patty. Season
with salt and pepper. Cook, undisturbed, until a golden
brown crust forms, and small holes appear around the edges.
Use a spatula to carefully lift 1 patty from the pan. Place
3 pickle slices in the pan and flip burger patty on top of
pickle slices. Top patty with cheese and flip second patty
on top of the cheese. Scrape the burger from the skillet and
place on bottom half of bbun. Place top bun on top with the
cut side facing up and return the whole burger to the
skillet. Cook and press each side, about 15 seconds. Serve
immediately.
