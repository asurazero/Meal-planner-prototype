Perfect Cast Iron Skillet Chicken Breasts


Ingredients
4 (6-ounce) skinless boneless chicken breasts
1 tablespoon dried Italian seasoning
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons canola oil
1/4 cup unsalted butter
3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
4 thyme sprigs
2 rosemary sprigs
lemon wedges, for serving (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Season chicken all over with Italian
seasoning, salt, smoked paprika, and black pepper. Heat oil
in a large cast-iron skillet over medium until shimmering.
Add chicken, rounded side down, and cook, undisturbed, until
the bottom side is browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and
continue to cook, undisturbed, until the other bottom side
is browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add butter, garlic, thyme, and
rosemary, and cook until butter is melted, about 1 minute.
Carefully tilt pan toward you so butter pools and spoon herb
butter over the top of each breast, until a thermometer
inserted into the thickest portion of breast registers 165
degrees F (74 degrees C), 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer chicken
to a serving platter and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve with
pan drippings and lemon wedges, if desired.
