California Spaghetti Salad


Ingredients
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 ½ teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 ½ teaspoons honey
1 clove minced garlic
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon dried basil
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
⅓ cup olive oil
1 pound thin spaghetti
1 cup baby spinach, rinsed and dried
1 cup chopped broccoli
1 cup frozen peas
1 carrot, grated
½ red onion, thinly sliced
½ cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced
1 Roma tomato, diced
4 ounces crumbled goat cheese, or to taste
¼ cup toasted sliced almonds, or to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Whisk together white wine vinegar, lemon juice, Parmesan
cheese, Italian seasoning, honey, garlic, Dijon mustard,
basil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl until well combined.
Gradually mix in olive oil, whisking constantly. Set
dressing aside. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to
a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring
occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12
minutes. While spaghetti cook, prepare all the vegetables.
Combine spinach, broccoli, peas, carrot, red onion,
cucumber, and tomato in a large bowl. Drain pasta, and add
to the bowl with the vegetables. Toss pasta and veggies
together. Pour dressing over pasta and veggies and toss
until thoroughly combined. Add in goat cheese and almonds
and toss again to combine. Cover pasta, and chill in the
fridge for at least 3 hours to overnight. Taste pasta salad,
and season with more salt and pepper, if necessary.
