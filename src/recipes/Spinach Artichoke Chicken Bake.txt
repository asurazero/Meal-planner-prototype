Spinach Artichoke Chicken Bake


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken breast
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup red onion
3 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon fresh basil,
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 ( 14.6 ounce) can artichoke hearts in water
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes,
1 1/2 cups fresh spinach
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat
olive oil and butter together in a large, ovenproof skillet
over medium heat. When butter is sizzling, add chicken
pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Brown one side of the
chicken pieces, 3 to 5 minutes; turn, and add diced red
onion, minced garlic, and minced fresh basil. (See Note.)
Cook, stirring often, until garlic is fragrant and onion is
softened, about 3 minutes. Season with pepper flakes, and
add artichokes and tomatoes. Stir in spinach; remove skillet
from heat. Combine Italian seasoned bread crumbs and
shredded Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture over
skillet contents. Bake in the center of the preheated oven,
uncovered, until bubbly and brown, about 25 minutes. Garnish
with fresh basil and serve warm.
