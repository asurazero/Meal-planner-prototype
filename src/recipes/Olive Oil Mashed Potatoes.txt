Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes


Ingredients
3 1/4 to 3 1/2 pounds russet potatoes
2 tablespoons salt
2 garlic cloves,
3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Add peeled and quartered potatoes to a sauce pan. Cover with
cold water by at least 1 inch. Season with salt and garlic,
and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Reduce heat to
medium-low and simmer gently until potatoes are very soft,
about 25 minutes. Drain potatoes and add back into the pot
or into a bowl. Use a potato masher to mash potatoes until
very smooth. Switch to a whisk or electric hand mixer, and
whip in the olive oil in two additions. Season to taste with
salt; serve with more olive oil drizzled over the top if
desired.
