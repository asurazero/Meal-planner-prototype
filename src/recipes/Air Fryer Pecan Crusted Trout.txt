Air Fryer Pecan Crusted Trout


Ingredients
2/3 cup chopped pecans
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons flour
1 large egg
4 (4- ounces) rainbow trout fillets, thawed if frozen, skinned if desired
2 teaspoons maple syrup
lemon wedges, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Stir
together pecans, rosemary, and salt in a shallow dish. In a
second shallow dish, add flour. In a third shallow dish,
lightly beat egg. Dip one side of each fillet in flour,
shaking off excess; dip into egg, then into pecan mixture,
lightly pressing to coat fish. Working in batches if needed,
arrange fillets on parchment paper, pecan-coating up.
Transfer fish on parchment to the air fryer basket. Cook
until fish easily flakes with a fork and an instant-read
thermometer inserted into thickest part of fillets registers
145 degrees F (62 degrees C), 7 to 8 minutes. Drizzle
fillets with maple syrup and serve with lemon wedges.
