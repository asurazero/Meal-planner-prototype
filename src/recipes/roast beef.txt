roast beef


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Using a sharp knife, make five deep slits around the top and
side of roast. Push one garlic clove into each slit. Place
roast in a slow cooker and pour coffee over top. Cover and
cook on Low until roast is browned and cooked through, about
3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the
thickest part of the roast should read 145 degrees F (65
degrees C), 6 to 8 hours. Transfer roast to a serving
platter. Pour drippings into a small saucepan over medium-
low heat. Whisk water and cornstarch together in a small
bowl; slowly pour into drippings and cook, stirring
constantly, until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve with
roast.
