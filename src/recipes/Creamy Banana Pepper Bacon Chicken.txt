Creamy Banana Pepper Bacon Chicken


Ingredients
5 slices bacon, chopped
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to an even thickness
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup sliced banana peppers
2 tablespoons brine from banana pepper jar
1 cup heavy cream
chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, until crisp,
stirring often. Remove bacon from skillet and set aside,
leaving drippings in the pan. Increase heat to medium-high.
Season chicken evenly with salt, pepper, and garlic powder
and add them to the hot skillet. Cook, undisturbed until
chicken is browned and easily releases from the pan, about 5
minutes. Flip the chicken and cook, 2 to 3 more minutes.
Remove chicken from skillet and set aside, keep warm. Add
onion, banana peppers and brine to the skillet and cook,
stirring constantly, until onion softens. Pour in heavy
cream and bring to a simmer. Return chicken to skillet along
with any juices that have accumulated. Reduce heat to
medium-low and simmer until chicken is cooked through and
mixture thickens slightly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chicken
to serving dish and stir feta cheese into the skillet.
Remove from heat and spoon creamy pepper mixture and sauce
over chicken. Top with reserved bacon and garnish with
parsley if desired.
