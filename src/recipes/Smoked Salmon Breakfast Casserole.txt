Smoked Salmon Breakfast Casserole


Ingredients
6 rye bagels
2 cups Swiss or provolone cheese
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
8 ounces smoked salmon
8 large eggs
2 cups whole milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup fresh dill
capers and lemon wedges, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a
9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spread half of the
toasted bagel pieces in prepared dish. Top with 1 1/2 cups
Swiss cheese, the cream cheese, and smoked salmon. Top with
remaining bagel pieces. Whisk together eggs, milk, sour
cream, and dill in a bowl. Pour over mixture in baking dish.
Press bagel pieces with the back of a spoon to coat in egg
mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Sprinkle
with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake 5 to 10 minutes more,
until set and an instant-read thermometer inserted into
center of casserole registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
Let stand about 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with
additional dill and serve with capers, lemon wedges, and/or
additional sour cream.
