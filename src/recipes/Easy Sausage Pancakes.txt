Easy Sausage Pancakes


Ingredients
2 cups pancake mix
1 1/3 cups water, plus more as needed
3 tablespoons butter, divided
8 sausage patties
syrup for dipping

Cooking Instructions

Combine pancake mix and water in a bowl and stir until just
blended (there may be a few lumps). Heat half of the butter
in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until melted.
Dip half of the sausage patties in the batter until evenly
coated and place in the skillet. Cook undisturbed until
lightly browned and slightly puffed, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip
and cook until the pancake is cooked through, 2 to 3 more
minutes. Repeat with remaining batter and sausage. Serve
with syrup if desired for dipping.
