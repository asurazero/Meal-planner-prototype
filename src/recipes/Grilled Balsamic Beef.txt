Grilled Balsamic Beef


Ingredients
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
6 garlic cloves
1/2 cup green onion
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons honey
1/4 cup fresh rosemary leaves
2 pounds beef top sirloin
4 skewers

Cooking Instructions

Whisk balsamic vinegar, olive oil, Worcestershire sauce,
garlic, green onion, salt, black pepper, cayenne, and honey
together in a bowl. Add rosemary and set aside. Cut beef
into cubes about 1 1/4- to 1 1/2- inch square and add to
marinade; stir to coat all cubes well. Wrap and refrigerate
overnight, tossing occasionally if possible. Thread beef on
4 skewers, and pat dry with paper towels before grilling.
Save any excess marinade for basting. Grill over high heat,
basting occasionally with marinade, about 5 minutes per side
for medium, or until beef reaches desired doneness. Remove
meat from grill and let rest 5 minutes before serving.
Meanwhile, bring remaining marinade to a boil in a saucepan.
Strain and use as a sauce for serving.
