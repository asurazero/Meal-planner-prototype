Mississippi Pot Roast Cheesesteak


Ingredients
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
4 to 5 pounds beef chuck roast
1/2 cup pepperoncini brine
1/4 cup water
1 (1 ounce) packet ranch dressing mix
1 (1 ounce) packet powdered au jus gravy mix,
1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into slices
6 pepperoncini peppers, or to taste
8 sandwich rolls
16 slices provolone cheese, or more to taste
processed cheese
2 cups peppers (1/4 cup per sandwich), or to taste

Cooking Instructions

Optional: to brown beef, heat oil in a skillet, Dutch oven,
or multi-functional cooker over high heat, and sear both
sides of beef until well browned, about 3 minutes per side.
Remove meat to a large slow cooker. Add pepperoncini brine
to the skillet, and stir to loosen any browned bits; pour
into the slow cooker. If you skipped the browning step, now
add meat and pepperoncini brine to the slow cooker. Drizzle
water over meat. Sprinkle ranch dressing evenly over the
top, then sprinkle au jus gravy mix evenly over. Top with
butter slices and peppers. Slow cook on Low until the meat
is very tender and can easily be pulled apart, 8 to 10
hours. At this point, you can use the beef for sandwiches,
or for anything you like. Remove beef from the slow cooker,
and shred the meat using two forks. For sandwiches, preheat
the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Slice sandwich
roll open, cover the open face with provolone cheese slices,
and place on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven
until the edges start to brown, about 7 minutes. Top roll
with hot, juicy shredded Mississippi pot roast. Garnish with
Cheez Whiz and pickled peppers and serve.
