Tres Leches Pancakes


Ingredients
2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/3 cup half and half
1 (15.25 oz) box French vanilla cake mix
1 1/4 cups almond milk
3 large eggs, lightly beaten
tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1/2 cup whipped cream, or as needed (optional) whipped cream, or as needed (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or as needed (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and half
and half in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring
to a boil, stirring constantly for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove
from heat and let cool. This is a sauce, not a syrup, so
consistency will be on the thinner side. Add cake mix,
almond milk, eggs, and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil to a
large bowl, and beat vigorously by hand for 2 minutes. Heat
a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and lightly
coat with remaining vegetable oil. Add 1/4 cup of the batter
for each pancake. Cook until edges begin to puff up, small
bubbles appear, pop, and leave small holes, 2 to 3 minutes.
Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on the other side,
about 2 minutes more. Serve pancakes warm with a drizzle of
the tres leches sauce, a dollop of whipped cream, and
sprinkle of cinnamon.
