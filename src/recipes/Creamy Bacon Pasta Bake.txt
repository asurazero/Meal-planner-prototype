Creamy Bacon Pasta Bake


Ingredients
8 ounces thick-cut bacon, chopped
1 yellow onion
1/4 cup tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
3 cups chicken broth
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup white wine
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1 pound spaghetti
1 tablespoon fresh flat-leaf parsley

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245
degrees C). Scatter bacon evenly over the bottom of a
13-x-9-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven,
stirring twice during cooking, until bacon is crispy and fat
has rendered, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and
transfer bacon to a small paper-towel-lined plate and set
aside. Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
C). Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the
baking dish. Add onion, tomato paste, and crushed red pepper
to reserved hot bacon fat in the baking dish and stir until
onion is well coated in tomato paste. Add chicken broth,
cream, wine, salt, 3/4 cup of the Parmigiano-Reggiano, and
stir to combine. Spread spaghetti into broth mixture and
bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C), uncovered, stirring
every 8 to 10 minutes, until spaghetti is tender, has
absorbed most of the sauce, and the sauce has thickened, 40
to 45 minutes. Remove and top with 1/4 cup of the reserved
bacon, remaining 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano and parsley.
Serve immediately, garnishing each serving with more
reserved bacon, as desired.
