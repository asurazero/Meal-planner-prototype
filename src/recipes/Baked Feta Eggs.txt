Baked Feta Eggs


Ingredients
2 small tomatoes
2 tablespoons red onion
1 clove garlic
1/2 cup feta cheese
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
fresh basil

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and spray
2 oven-safe ramekins with cooking spray. Combine tomatoes,
red onions, and garlic in a small bowl and divide evenly
between ramekins. Sprinkle with feta cheese, drizzle with
olive oil, and sprinkle with oregano. Place ramekins on a
baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes.
Remove from oven; do not turn oven off. Gently stir feta
into tomato mixture. With the back of a spoon, make
indentations in tomato mixture. Crack an egg into each
indentation. Return ramekins to the oven, and bake until egg
whites are opaque but yolks are still runny, or cooked to
your taste, 10 to 14 minutes. Season with salt and pepper,
garnish with basil, and serve.
