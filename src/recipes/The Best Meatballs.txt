The Best Meatballs


Ingredients
1 pound ground beef
½ pound ground veal
½ pound ground pork
1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese
2 eggs
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 ½ tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled
1 ½ cups lukewarm water
1 cup olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Combine beef, veal, and pork in a
large bowl. Mix in cheese, eggs, garlic, parsley, salt, and
pepper. Add bread crumbs and slowly mix in water, 1/2 cup at
a time, until mixture is moist but still holds its shape (I
usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water); shape into
meatballs. Heat olive oil in a large skillet; add meatballs
in batches and cook until browned on all sides, slightly
crisp, and cooked through, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain on
paper towels. Enjoy!
