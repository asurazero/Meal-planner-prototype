Ham and Gruyère Scones


Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter
3/4 cup cooked ham
3/4 cup GruyÃ¨re cheese
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 large egg
1 teaspoon water
1 pinch salt

Cooking Instructions

Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large
mixing bowl. Use a pastry cutter to cut butter into flour
mixture until it resembles rice or coarse meal. Stir in ham
and GruyÃ¨re until evenly mixed. Moisten flour mixture with
cream, until dough begins to come together. Add a bit more
cream, milk, or water if dough seems dry. Turn out on a
floured work surface and fold dough onto itself. Gently
stretch dough, turning and folding 3 or 4 times. Lightly
flour a rolling pin and roll dough out 1/2- to 3/4-inch
thick, turning dough a quarter turn occasionally. Cut scones
with a lightly floured 3-inch biscuit cutter; press cutter
straight down, without twisting. Pat dough scraps together
and cut as needed. Line a baking sheet with parchment; place
cut scones on the sheet. Whisk egg, water, and pinch salt
together in a small bowl. Brush tops of scones with egg
wash, and refrigerate for about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven
to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). Brush the top of the
scones with the egg mixture again. Bake scones in the center
of the preheated oven until tops are crispy and lightly
browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room
temperature.
