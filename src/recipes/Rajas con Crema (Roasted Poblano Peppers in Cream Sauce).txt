Rajas con Crema (Roasted Poblano Peppers in Cream Sauce)


Ingredients
4 large poblano peppers
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion
2 cloves garlic
3/4 cup Mexican crema
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup Oaxaca cheese

Cooking Instructions

Place poblano chiles directly on the grates of a gas stove.
Cook over medium heat, flipping with tongs occasionally,
until blackened and charred, about 5 minutes. Place in a
sealed plastic bag and allow to cool, 5 to 6 minutes. Peel
off charred skins, remove seeds, and slice chiles into
strips. Set aside. Melt butter in a large skillet. Add
onions and cook until soft and translucent, 6 to 7 minutes.
Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add
poblano peppers, Mexican crema, salt, chicken bouillon, and
pepper; cook and stir until combined. Turn off heat, add
cheese, and stir until melted.
