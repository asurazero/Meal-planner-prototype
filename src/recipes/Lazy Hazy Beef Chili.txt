Lazy Hazy Beef Chili


Ingredients
2 pounds ground beef
2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon chipotle
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
12 ounces beer
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (14.5 ounce) tomatoes with green chilies
2 (16 ounce jars) extra chunky salsa
2 15 ounce) cans pinto beans, drained
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup green onions
1 cup sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup chopped cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Add beef to a dry cold pot, and turn heat to high. When beef
begins to sizzle, break up into small pieces with a potato
masher or spatula. Meat can be broken up into very fine
crumbles, or into larger chunks, depending on the desired
texture. Continue to cook and break up beef until no longer
pink, about 7 minutes. Add chili powder, chipotle, black
pepper, salt, and cinnamon to the pot. Cook, stirring, for 1
minute, then pour in beer. Stir, scraping the browned bits
from the bottom of the pot as you do. Let mixture boil until
liquid is reduced by about half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sugar,
oregano, garlic powder, diced tomatoes and jarred salsa.
Stir in; return mixture to a simmer. Stir in beans, reduce
heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until
chili is thickened and flavor is developed to your liking,
about 1 hour. Taste, adjust the seasoning. Top with sour
cream, green onions, Cheddar cheese, and cilantro as
desired.
