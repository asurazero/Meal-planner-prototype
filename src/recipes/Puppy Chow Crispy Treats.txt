Puppy Chow Crispy Treats


Ingredients
6 ounces 72% dark chocolate chips
3/4 cup creamy peanut butter
8 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
12 ounce rice cereal squares
1 tablespoon powdered sugar
8 cups miniature marshmallows
cooking spray
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter (such as Skippy)

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Place chocolate chips, 3/4 cup
peanut butter, and 4 tablespoons butter in a large
microwave-safe heatproof bowl. Microwave on HIGH until
melted and smooth, stirring every 30 seconds, 1 1/2 to 2
minutes; stir in salt. Place cereal into a very large bowl.
Pour melted chocolate mixture over cereal; fold until cereal
is evenly coated. Let rest for 15 minutes. Rinse and dry
bowl used to melt chocolate mixture and set aside. Add 1 cup
powdered sugar to cereal mixture; fold until evenly coated
(itâ€™s ok if some powdered sugar dissolves). Spread into an
even layer on a large-rimmed, parchment-lined baking sheet
and set aside. Rinse and dry bowl used to coat cereal
mixture and set aside. Place remaining 4 tablespoons butter
and marshmallows in reserved large bowl. Microwave on HIGH
until marshmallows have puffed and start turning into one
mass, about 45 seconds. Stir well and add 2 tablespoons
peanut butter. Microwave for 30 more seconds, and stir again
until smooth. Place cereal mixture back into reserved very
large bowl and pour marshmallow mixture over cereal. Quickly
fold and stir until evenly coated. Spray a 13-x 9-inch
baking pan with cooking spray. Spread cereal mixture into
pan, lightly pressing into an even layer; let sit at room
temperature until set, about 1 hour. Sift remaining 1
tablespoon powdered sugar over cereal mixture, cut into 12
(3-x-3.25- inch) pieces and serve.
