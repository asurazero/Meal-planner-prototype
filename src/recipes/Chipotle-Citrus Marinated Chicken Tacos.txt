Chipotle-Citrus Marinated Chicken Tacos


Ingredients
2 limes, juiced
1 orange, juiced
1/4 cup olive oil
1 chipotle pepper in adobo
3 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts
24 corn tortilla
1 small onion, diced
1/4 cup chopped cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Combine lime juice, orange juice, olive oil, chipotle
pepper, garlic, cumin, coriander, salt, and black pepper in
a blender. Blend on high until smooth. Pour marinade mixture
into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken breasts to the
bag; marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours. Preheat a
grill to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place marinated
chicken breasts on the grill; close the lid. Discard the
marinade. Grill, turning once, until chicken is no longer
pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes
per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove chicken from grill. Let stand for 5 minutes; slice
into strips. Heat tortillas over a griddle on medium heat
until tortillas are soft and pliable. Stack tortillas in
pairs; divide chicken, onion, and cilantro onto each pair of
tortillas.
