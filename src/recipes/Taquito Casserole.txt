Taquito Casserole


Ingredients
cooking spray
1 (19 ounce) can enchilada sauce
1 (15 ounce) can black beans drained and rinsed
2 1/2 cups frozen corn
1 (8.8 ounce) package white rice
1 cup red bell pepper
1/2 cup red onion
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
16 ounces shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided
20 beef and cheese flour tortilla taquitos
1/2 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons pickling liquid from jarred pickled jalapenos
2 tablespoons pickled jalapenos
1/4 cup cilantro leaves

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
(190 degrees C). Lightly coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with
cooking spray; set aside. Stir together enchilada sauce,
beans, corn, rice, bell pepper, red onion, cream, taco
seasoning, salt, paprika, cumin, and 3 cups shredded cheese
in a large bowl until well combined. Spread into the
prepared baking dish in an even layer. Arrange taquitos
evenly over rice mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until
taquitos are crispy and rice mixture is bubbling, about 40
minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together sour cream, lime juice,
and pickling liquid in a small bowl until smooth. Set aside,
uncovered, at room temperature until ready to serve. Remove
baking dish from oven, and sprinkle evenly with remaining
cheese. Top evenly with jalapeño slices. Bake at 375 degrees
F (190 degrees C) until cheese is melted, about 8 minutes
more. Let stand for 10 minutes. Top evenly with cilantro
leaves. Drizzle each serving with jalapeño crema.
