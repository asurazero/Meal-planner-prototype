Roasted Red Pepper Sauce


Ingredients
2 red bell peppers
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 cloves garlic
1/2 ounce fresh basil
1 tablespoon prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon smoked paprika

Cooking Instructions

Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cut peppers in half. Remove and discard stems, seeds, and
membranes. Place peppers, skin side up, on the preheated
grill, directly over heat; cook until slightly charred, 3 to
5 minutes. Turn peppers over and char the other side. Remove
from the grill to cool slightly. Combine peppers,
mayonnaise, lemon juice, garlic, horseradish, and smoked
paprika in the container of a blender; cover and blend until
smooth.
