Shrimp Quesadillas


Ingredients
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion, sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced
1 lime, juiced
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
6 large flour tortillas
3 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided

Cooking Instructions

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high
heat. Add onion and bell peppers; cook, stirring frequently,
until onion is translucent and peppers are soft, 6 to 8
minutes. Add salt, cumin, and chili powder; stir to coat
vegetables. Add shrimp; cook and stir until shrimp are
opaque and no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.
Remove from the heat and stir in minced jalapeño and lime
juice. Heat another skillet over medium heat and brush with
about 1 teaspoon oil. Place one tortilla in the hot skillet;
spoon about 1/6 of the shrimp filling and 1/2 cup Mexican
cheese blend onto one side of tortilla. Fold tortilla in
half. Cook until lightly browned on the bottom, about 5
minutes. Flip and cook until lightly browned on the other
side, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat to make remaining quesadillas.
