Café Tropical Burrito


Ingredients
2 strips bacon
1 patty frozen hashbrown
2 eggs
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar and Swiss cheese mixture
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 (12-Inch) flour tortilla

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Place bacon in a large skillet and
cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until
evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain most of
the bacon grease out of the skillet. Add hashbrown patty to
the remaining hot bacon grease and fry over medium heat
until hot, crispy, and golden brown, about 5 minutes. You
can also use canola or grapeseed oil instead of bacon grease
Meanwhile, pour beaten eggs into a nonstick pan or flat top;
let cook undisturbed until the bottom of the eggs begins to
firm, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in Cheddar and Swiss cheese and
season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until eggs are
nearly set, light, and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes more. While
eggs are cooking, heat tortilla on the stovetop until
lightly browned and warm. To assemble the burrito, place
hashbrown patty onto the tortilla. Top with scrambled eggs
and bacon. Fold two sides of the burrito to the center, roll
up, and serve.
