portion of strawberry syrup over strawberry layer. Add
another single layer of cake pieces, and spread with yogurt.
Sprinkle with blueberries. Place blueberry preserves and 1
tablespoon water in a microwave-safe bowl and heat on High
until preserves have melted, about 1 minute. Stir, and add

Drizzle a portion of blueberry syrup over blueberries. Add
another layer of cake pieces; spread with yogurt, add a
layer of strawberries, and drizzle with strawberry syrup.

whole berries, and blueberries, and drizzle with any
remaining syrup. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
