Smashed Broccoli with Cheese


Ingredients
3 broccoli crowns, cut into large florets (about 1 pound)
6 ounces shredded Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place
broccoli florets in a microwave-safe dish. Cook on High for
4 minutes. Transfer broccoli to a cutting board. Using a
small glass or shot glass, smash the florets flat. Spread
shredded Parmesan in a single layer on the prepared baking
sheet. Divide smashed broccoli evenly over cheese. Season
broccoli with garlic powder and lemon pepper seasoning. Bake
in the preheated oven until Parmesan layer is crisp and tips
of broccoli are well browned, about 30 minutes. Break up and
serve immediately.
