Parmesan-Crusted Smashed Cauliflower


Ingredients
1 (2 1/2 pound) head cauliflower
1/2 cup water
1 cup Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
fresh flat-leaf parsley
ranch dressing

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220
degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment
paper; set aside. Place cauliflower in a large microwave-
safe bowl. Add water; cover with plastic wrap. Microwave on
HIGH until stalks are just tender enough to pierce with a
paring knife, about 4 minutes. Drain well. Wipe bowl clean
and return drained cauliflower to bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 cup
Parmesan cheese in an even layer over the prepared baking
sheet. Add oil, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and
pepper to cauliflower; toss until evenly coated. Place in an
even layer on top of the Parmesan cheese on the baking
sheet. Use a heavy-bottomed glass or jar to smash
cauliflower florets, taking care not to break them fully
apart. Sprinkle evenly with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Bake
in the preheated oven until cheese is crispy and golden
brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Break apart if needed. Garnish with
parsley and serve with ranch dressing, if desired.
