2 large eggs
1/3 cup flour
1 teaspoon parsley
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 tilapia filets

Cooking Instructions

In a blender or food processor, combine panko, Parmesan

beat eggs with a fork; set aside. Combine flour, parsley,
garlic powder, and pepper in a bowl; set aside. Heat butter
