1 tablespoon wine
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup oyster sauce
2 tablespoons wine
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Cooking Instructions

Gather Ingredients. For Chicken Coating, whisk together
cornstarch, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and pepper in a large
bowl. Mixture will be quite thick. Add chicken pieces to
bowl; stir to coat chicken. Let stand at room temperature
for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, for Black Pepper Sauce, whisk
together chicken broth, oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine, soy
sauce, water, cornstarch, and pepper in a medium bowl. Heat
2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a 12-inch skillet over
medium-high heat. Add half the chicken. Cook and stir until
lightly browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Transfer chicken to a plate; set aside. Repeat with
remaining chicken. Remove chicken from skillet. Add
remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to skillet. Stir in
minced garlic and ginger. Cook and stir until fragrant,
about 30 seconds. Stir in bell pepper and onion. Cook and
stir until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in Black
Pepper Sauce and cook until sauce has thickened, 2 to 3
minutes. Return cooked chicken to skillet. Cook and stir
until all ingredients are coated with sauce. Serve
immediately over cooked white rice.
