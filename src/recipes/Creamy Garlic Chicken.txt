Creamy Garlic Chicken


Ingredients
1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
8 garlic cloves,
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, or as needed (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine herb seasoning, salt, pepper, granulated garlic, and
flour in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag and mix well.
Combine butter and olive oil in a large, nonstick skillet
over medium heat. Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels,
place in the bag of seasoned flour, seal, and toss chicken
thighs in the flour mixture until evenly coated. When butter
stops sizzling, add chicken pieces and cook until nicely
browned, no longer pink at the center and juices run clear,
4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer
inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74
degrees C). Remove to a plate and keep warm. Add smashed
garlic to the same skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and
cook garlic, stirring frequently, just until fragrant, no
longer than 1 minute. Add cream to the skillet, and stir up
any browned bits in the bottom of the pan. Stir in chicken
broth. Increase heat to medium, and bring the sauce to a
boil, stirring occasionally. Cook until the sauce is reduced
by half, about 10 minutes. Sample garlic cream sauce and
adjust seasoning, if necessary. Return chicken to the
skillet and stir in any accumulated juices. Allow chicken to
heat through. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve.
