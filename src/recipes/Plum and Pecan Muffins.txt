Plum and Pecan Muffins


Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
1 cup plain Greek yogurt (
1/2 cup orange juice
2 large eggs
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups plums
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spray a
12-cup standard muffin tin with cooking spray or line with
paper liners. In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar,
baking powder, ginger, baking soda, and salt. In a separate
bowl, whisk yogurt, orange juice, eggs, butter, and vanilla
until well combined. Make a well in the center of dry
ingredients; pour yogurt mixture into well and stir just
until batter is combined. Gently fold in plums and pecans.
Evenly spoon batter into the prepared muffin tin cups. Bake
in the preheated oven until muffins are golden and a
toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 20 to 25
minutes. Allow muffins to cool in the pan for 5 minutes,
then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
