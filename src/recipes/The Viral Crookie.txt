The Viral Crookie


Ingredients
2 large croissants
1 cup chocolate chip cookie dough

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment. Slice croissants in half
lengthwise. Place about 1/4 cup cookie dough in large chunks
into the center of each croissant. Divide remaining half cup
dough into 4 portions and place 2 portions on top by lightly
pressing them on to the croissant. Place prepared croissants
on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven
until the top cookie dough is lightly browned around the
edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving.
