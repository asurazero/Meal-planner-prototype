Roasted Beet Salad with Feta


Ingredients
4 beets, trimmed, leaving 1 inch of stems attached
¼ cup minced shallot
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
salt and pepper to taste
¼ cup crumbled feta cheese

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C). Wrap each beet individually in aluminum
foil and place onto a baking sheet. Bake beets in preheated
oven until easily pierced with a fork, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Allow beets to cool until you can handle them. Peel beets
and cut into 1/4-inch slices. While beets are roasting,
whisk shallots, parsley, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and
red wine vinegar together in a bowl until blended; season
with salt and pepper and set aside. Place warm, sliced beets
onto a serving dish; pour vinaigrette over the beets and
sprinkle with feta cheese.
