Chicken Liver Pate


Ingredients
16 ounces chicken livers
8 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 cup shallots
1 clove garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves
2 tablespoons dry sherry
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Cooking Instructions

Trim chicken livers of any membrane, dry on paper towels,
and set aside. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet
over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and saute
until softened, about 3 minutes. Add chicken livers, thyme,
sherry, salt, and pepper to the pan, and increase
temperature to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally,
until livers are just turning light pink in the center, 3 to
4 minutes. If youâ€™re unsure how cooked the livers are, cut
one in half to check. Transfer to a food processor. Add
heavy cream, remaining 4 tablespoons butter, and nutmeg, and
blend until very smooth, adding a little more cream if
necessary to reach a good spreading consistency. Transfer to
a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours
or overnight. Serve in ramekins or small jars, and garnish
as desired.
