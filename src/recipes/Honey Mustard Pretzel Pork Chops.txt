Honey Mustard Pretzel Pork Chops


Ingredients
2 large eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons hot sauce
3 cups honey mustard pretzels
4 pork chops
1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons mustard
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Set a
wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet; set aside. Whisk
eggs and hot sauce together in a shallow dish. Crush
pretzels in a food processor or plastic bag and add them to
a second shallow dish. Season pork chops evenly with 1
teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Coat each pork chop
in egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off, then coat each
liberally in pretzel crumbs. Heat oil in a large skillet
over medium-high heat. Cook pork chops, 2 at a time, until
golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer them to the
prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until no
longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees
F (63 degrees C). Meanwhile, combine mustard, mayonnaise,
honey, vinegar, and remaining salt and pepper in a small
bowl and mix well. Microwave mustard sauce for 15 seconds,
stir, and serve with pork chops.
