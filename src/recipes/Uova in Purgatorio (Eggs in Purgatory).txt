Ingredients
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, crushed
3 black Italian olives, pitted and chopped, or more to taste
1 teaspoon capers
1 anchovy fillet in oil, drained
7 ounces Italian tomato sauce (crushed tomatoes)
Â½ cup water
1 sprig chopped fresh parsley
salt to taste
2 large eggs

Cooking Instructions

Heat oil in a skillet over low heat. Add garlic, olives,
capers, and anchovy; cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomato
sauce and water, bring to a boil, and simmer until flavors
