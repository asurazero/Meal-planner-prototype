Slow Cooker Chicken Apple Butter Meatballs


Ingredients
1 small Granny Smith apple (about 6 ounces)
1 pound ground chicken
1/2 cup panko
1 large egg
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon fresh thyme
3/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 1/2 cups apple butter
1 cup chicken stock
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
3/4 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
decorative toothpicks

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Peel apple; discard peels. Grate
apple on the largest holes of a box grater to yield 2/3 cup.
Place grated apple in a large bowl. Add chicken, panko, egg,
salt, thyme, poultry seasoning, and black pepper to bowl
with grated apples. Mix until just combined. Shape into 18
balls (about 2 tablespoons each). Stir together apple
butter, chicken stock, Worcestershire, and chicken bouillon
in a 6-quart slow cooker bowl. Place meatballs in sauce
mixture. Cover and cook until meatballs are cooked through
and sauce thickens enough to coat the meatballs, about 2
hours on HIGH or 4 hours on LOW, stirring halfway through.
Stir in butter until melted and season with additional salt
to taste. Transfer meatballs and sauce to a platter; insert
each meatball with a toothpick and garnish with chopped
thyme.
