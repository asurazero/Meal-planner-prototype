Cooking Instructions

Melt butter with oil in a deep cast iron skillet over medium
heat. Add chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 3
minutes. Add minced garlic and ground beef; cook and stir,
breaking up the meat with a spatula, until beef is crumbly
and browned, about 7 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce and
evaporated milk. Add pickle relish, Dijon mustard,
granulated garlic, granulated onion, Montreal steak
seasoning, chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper,
and stir to combine. Reserve 1/4 cup beef broth, and pour
remaining beef broth into the skillet. Whisk flour and the
1/4 cup beef broth together in a small bowl to make a
slurry; stir slurry into the skillet. Stir in dry macaroni
until pasta is fully submerged. Bring mixture to a boil,
reduce the heat to low, and simmer, covered, until macaroni
is tender with a bite, about 10 minutes. Set a rack about 6
inches from the heat source and preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler.
Stir 2 cups cheese into macaroni mixture. Sprinkle remaining
cheese evenly across the top of the skillet. Broil until
cheese is golden, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately.
