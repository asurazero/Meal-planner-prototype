Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Stir together chicken broth, garlic,
heavy cream, Italian seasoning, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a
4- to 5-quart slow cooker. Season chicken on both sides with
remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon
olive oil in a large skillet over medium. Working in
batches, sear half of the chicken until browned, 3 minutes
each side. Remove chicken from skillet and place in slow
cooker. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken. Cover and
cook on low for 2 to 3 hours or until the chicken registers
165 degress F (74 degrees C) on an instant read thermometer.
Using tongs, transfer chicken and garlic cloves to a serving
platter. Whisk together lemon juice and cornstarch in a
medium microwave-safe bowl. Add cooking liquid to the bowl;
microwave for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until thickened,
stirring every 30 seconds. Stir lemon zest into sauce. Serve
chicken with lemon sauce and lemon wedges, if desired.
Enjoy!
