Chocolate-Peanut Butter Oat Bars


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups flour
1 cup rolled oats
3/4 cup pecans
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut
1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line bottom
of a 9-inch square baking pan with foil. Lightly coat with
cooking spray. For crust, pulse flour, oats, pecans, white
sugar, coconut, brown sugar, and salt in a food processor
until blended. Add butter; pulse until mixture resembles wet
sand. Spoon three-fourths of oat mixture (about 4 1/2 cups)
into the prepared pan. Press into an even layer. Transfer
remaining one-fourth of mixture to a small bowl; using your
hands, squeeze and rub mixture together until crumbly.
Spread streusel on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake both pans,
stirring streusel halfway through, until streusel is golden,
about 18 minutes. Remove streusel from oven. Bake crust
until golden brown, about 12 minutes more. Meanwhile, for
filling, microwave chocolate chips and peanut butter in a
medium microwave-safe bowl on High in 30-second intervals,
stirring after each interval, until mixture is melted and
fully combined. To assemble, pour chocolate mixture over
baked crust. Sprinkle with streusel. Chill until set, 2 to 3
hours. Cut into 20 bars.
