Boursin Omelet


Ingredients
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon water
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon chives
1 ounce cheese, such as

Cooking Instructions

Whisk eggs, water, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until
yolks and whites are completely combined and eggs are light
and frothy, about 30 seconds. Melt butter in an 8-inch
nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour eggs into skillet
and stir rapidly for 20 to 30 seconds until eggs are just
starting to set. Spread top of eggs in an even layer and let
cook until just slightly underdone and shiny. If necessary,
move extra raw egg around to the edges of the skillet. Lower
heat to medium-low to prevent browning, if necessary.
Sprinkle cheese down the middle of the omelet, along with 2
teaspoons chives. Fold one side over the cheese in the
middle, followed by the other side, so the omelet is folded
in thirds. Remove to a plate and sprinkle with remaining
chives.
