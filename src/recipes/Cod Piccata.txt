Cod Piccata


Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds cod filets,
salt and pepper to taste
4 teaspoons flour,
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 large lemon
2 tablespoons shallot
3 tablespoons capers
1/4 cup white wine
3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons parsley, plus a few sprigs for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Pat cod filets dry with paper towels and lightly season both
sides with salt and pepper. Use a scant teaspoon of flour to
very lightly dust one side of cod filets. See note. Melt 2
tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium high heat.
When butter stops bubbling, add cod filets, floured side
down. Cook undisturbed, until a light brown color develops,
about 3 minutes. Keeping the floured side up, carefully
remove filets from skillet and keep warm. Cook lemon slices
in the same skillet for 2 to 3 minutes, turning to cook
evenly, and add shallots and capers. Cook about 1 minute
more. Stir in white wine; cook about 1 minute, scraping up
any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Stir in
chicken broth and chopped parsley, and squeeze juice of
reserved lemon half into the skillet; cook about 4 minutes.
Gently return filets to the skillet, floured side up. Cook
in the sauce until an instant read thermometer inserted in
the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove to a
serving plate, floured side up, and keep warm. Remove about
1/4 cup of liquid from skillet; allow to cool slightly. Add
remaining 2 tablespoons butter to skillet and stir until
melted. Whisk cooled liquid and remaining flour together to
make a smooth slurry. Stir slurry briskly into the skillet,
and cook until sauce is thickened and bubbly. Pour sauce
over cod filets, and garnish with parsley sprigs.
