Ginger Chicken


Ingredients
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons wine or rice vinegar
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 cup tap water, divided
4 scallions, sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 teaspoons cornstarch
sesame seeds for garnish
2 cups white rice, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Whisk together brown sugar, soy
sauce, Shaoxing wine, white pepper, and 1/2 cup of the water
until combined; set aside. Thinly slice scallions, and
separate white and light green parts from dark green parts;
set aside. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high
until shimmering. Sprinkle both sides of chicken evenly with
salt and black pepper. Add chicken to skillet, rounded sides
down, and cook until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Flip
chicken, and continue to cook until a thermometer inserted
into thickest portion registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees
C), about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large plate, and cover
loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Add ginger, garlic,
and reserved white and light green scallion parts to
drippings in skillet, and cook over medium-high, stirring
often, until garlic and ginger are fragrant and lightly
toasted, and scallions are starting to fall apart, 3 to 4
minutes. Whisk together cornstarch and remaining 1
tablespoon water until smooth. Add cornstarch mixture and
soy sauce mixture to skillet. Bring to a boil over medium-
high. Reduce heat to low to maintain a simmer, and cook,
stirring constantly, until sauce thickens and coats the back
of a spoon, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Return chicken
and any residual juices to skillet, tossing to coat evenly
in soy sauce mixture. Garnish with sesame seeds and dark
green scallion parts. Serve over rice.
