Peach Custard Pie


Ingredients
1 pie crust shell
2 peaches
4 large eggs
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup whole milk
1/2 cup butter

Cooking Instructions

To blind bake the crust (optional): Chill pastry-filled pie
pan at least 20 minutes before baking to prevent shrinkage.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line
pastry with parchment or a double layer of aluminum foil and
a layer of pie weights or dried beans. Bake in the preheated
oven for about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, carefully
remove the foil and weights, and let cool to room
temperature, about 20 minutes. The base of the crust will
have turned a very light golden brown. Reduce the oven
temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). For custard:
combine eggs, white sugar, and brown sugar in a bowl, and
whisk vigorously until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.
Add flour, cornmeal, salt, vanilla, vinegar, milk, and
butter, and whisk vigorously until you achieve a smooth,
emulsified batter, about 2 minutes. Arrange 12 peach slices
on the bottom of the crust. Whisk batter again, and slowly
ladle into the crust, being careful not to move the peach
slices out of place. Bake in the preheated oven at 350
degrees F (175 degrees C) until top is browned and a very
sharp knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 50 to
60 minutes. The pie should not be liquid, but jiggle when
the pie dish is moved back and forth. Let cool completely
before serving. For best results, chill in the refrigerator
before serving.
