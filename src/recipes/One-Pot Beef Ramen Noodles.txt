One-Pot Beef Ramen Noodles


Ingredients
1 pound ground beef
3 cups cabbage
1 1/2 cups red bell pepper
3 garlic, minced
2 cups chicken stock
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
2 packages instant ramen noodles
1 cup carrots
scallions
toasted sesame seeds

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Heat a medium Dutch oven over
medium-high heat. Add the beef; cook, stirring occasionally
to break the meat into crumbles, until browned and no longer
pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in cabbage, bell peppers, and
garlic. Cook, stirring often, until vegetables begin to wilt
and cabbage is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken
broth, soy sauce, hoisin sauce; bring it to a boil over
medium high heat. Once at a boil, nestle in ramen, spooning
the beef mixture over the ramen as needed to make sure the
ramen is fully submerged. Reduce the heat to medium. Cover
and cook, undisturbed, until the ramen is tender, 5 to 7
minutes. Stir in carrots. Cover and remove from heat. Let
sit until carrots are tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with
scallions and sesame seeds. Serve.
