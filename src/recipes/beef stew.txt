Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Combine beef and flour in a large resealable plastic bag and
toss to coat evenly. In a 6-quart saucepan, brown beef in
hot vegetable oil. Season with salt and pepper, if desired.
Add diced tomatoes, beef broth, carrots, potatoes, and
thyme. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover,
and simmer for 1 hour or until beef is tender. Blend in
mustard and serve.
