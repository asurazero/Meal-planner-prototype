Pistachio Pesto Pasta with Shrimp


Ingredients
2 tablespoons pistachios
1 1/2 cups basil leaves
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup olive oil
1 garlic clove, peeled
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)
lemon juice to taste
14 1/2 ounces fusilli pasta
1 pound shrimp
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Cooking Instructions

For pesto, place a skillet over medium-high heat, and toast
pistachios until fragrant, tossing frequently, about 1
minute. Remove pistachios to a plate to cool completely,
about 10 minutes. Combine pistachios, basil, Parmesan
cheese, olive oil, and garlic in a blender or food processor
and pur√©e until smooth. Season to taste with salt and lemon
juice. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,
until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Reserve
1 tablespoon pasta water; drain. Gently stir 1/4 cup pesto
into pasta with a slotted spoon. Add shrimp, garlic powder,
salt, and black pepper to a bowl. Toss to thoroughly coat
shrimp in seasonings. Heat a large skillet over medium heat.
Add butter; once melted, add shrimp to the skillet in a
single even layer. Cook shrimp on one side until seared, 2
to 3 minutes. Flip shrimp and cook until shrimp is seared,
pink, and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes more. Add shrimp to pasta.
Add reserved pasta water if needed to thin sauce, and serve.
