Spinach Feta and Rice Casserole


Ingredients
1 cup scallions
1/4 cup drained, chopped sun-dried tomatoes in oil
1 tablespoon garlic
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 (16 ounce) package spinach
3 cups vegetable broth
1 1/2 cups white rice
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon black pepper
6 ounces feta cheese
1/2 cup fresh dill

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F
(190 degrees C). Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over
medium-high heat. Add scallions, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic,
and oregano; cook, stirring often, until scallions soften,
about 2 minutes. Add spinach, and cook, stirring
occasionally, until thawed, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in broth,
rice, lemon zest and juice, salt, pepper, and 1 cup of the
feta. Bring to a simmer over high heat, stirring
occasionally. Stir in dill, and top evenly with remaining
1/2 cup feta. Bake in the preheated oven until rice is
tender and feta begins to brown, about 20 minutes.
