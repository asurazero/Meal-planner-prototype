Apple Cider Chicken


Ingredients
2 boneless chicken breasts
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
6 sage leaves (optional)
2 tablespoons shallot or onion
1 1/4 cups apple cider
1/3 cup apple cider vinegar

Cooking Instructions

Season chicken on both sides with salt, black pepper, and
cayenne and set aside. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a
skillet over medium heat; add sage leaves and fry until
crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and reserve. Add chicken
breasts to the same skillet, and cook until just cooked
through, about 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and
cover loosely with foil. Add shallots to the skillet; saut√©
for 1 minute. Pour in cider and vinegar, and bring to a
simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until reduced by half,
which will only take a few minutes. Reduce heat to low and
place chicken back in, along with any accumulated juices
from the plate. Cook for a few minutes, turning
occasionally, and basting with the hot sauce until the
chicken is hot. An instant read thermometer inserted into
the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove
to a serving plate. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the
pan, and turn off the heat. Swirl pan until butter
emulsifies into the sauce. Taste for seasoning and serve on
chicken, garnished with fried sage.
