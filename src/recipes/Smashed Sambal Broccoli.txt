Smashed Sambal Broccoli


Ingredients
1 bunch broccoli, cut into florets
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons Asian-style chili paste
3 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

Cooking Instructions

Set oven rack about 6 inches from heat source and preheat
broiler. Put a steamer basket in a large saucepan. Add water
to just below steamer basket. Bring to a boil. Add broccoli
to steamer basket; reduce heat to medium-low. Steam,
covered, until crisp-tender, 4 minutes. When cool enough to
handle, spread broccoli on a 10x15-inch rimmed baking sheet.
Using the bottom of a sturdy glass, flatten broccoli florets
to 1/2 inch thick. Drizzle with vegetable oil and sprinkle
with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Broil until charred
around edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together chili
paste, garlic, maple syrup, and sesame oil in a small bowl.
Spoon over broccoli. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
