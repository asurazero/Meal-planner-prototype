Summer Meat Slaw


Ingredients
1 head green cabbage
1/2 cup green onions
1 red bell pepper
1 large carrot
2 cloves garlic
4 cups pulled pork
1/4 cup avocado oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons riracha
1/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1/3 cup chopped cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Halve and core cabbage; cut each half into 2 pieces, and
slice cabbage into 1/4-inch thick strips; set aside. Add
green onions, bell pepper, and garlic to a large mixing
bowl. With a vegetable peeler, peel thin strips of carrot
over the top. Place a nonstick skillet over high heat and
add pork. Cook until pork is very hot and a brown crust is
forming on the meat, about 5 minutes. If meat is lean, 1 to
2 tablespoons of oil can be added to the pan as needed. Pour
hot pork over veggies and mix with tongs to combine. Add 2
tablespoons oil to the same pan and place over high heat.
Transfer in cabbage and salt. Cook, stirring, until cabbage
softens and starts to brown in spots, but still retains a
bit of crunch. Add cabbage, black pepper, Sriracha, and rice
vinegar to the bowl; mix slaw thoroughly. Add cilantro, and
mix thoroughly. Taste for seasoning, and adjust salt and
pepper, heat, and vinegar as needed. Serve hot, warm, or at
room temperature, garnished with thinly sliced green onion.
If making ahead, warm slaw before serving.
