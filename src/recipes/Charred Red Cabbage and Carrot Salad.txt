Charred Red Cabbage and Carrot Salad


Ingredients
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 1/2 pounds red cabbage -
1/2 red onion,
2 large carrots
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1 tablespoon honey, or to taste
1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup green onions

Cooking Instructions

Line a baking sheet with foil, and grease with a few
teaspoons of vegetable oil. Arrange cabbage slices, cut side
up if possible, on the sheet, and drizzle remaining
vegetable oil evenly over cabbage. Set an oven rack about 7
inches from the heat source and preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler.
Broil until the surface of cabbage is lightly charred, 4 to
6 minutes. Times will vary depending on your oven, so watch
closely during each charring step. Use a spatula and tongs
to turn cabbage over; return to the broiler to char the
other side of cabbage, 3 to 6 minutes. Once both sides of
cabbage are lightly charred, scatter over sliced onions and
use a vegetable peeler to make long, thick strips of carrot
over the top. Arrange carrot strips evenly on top, and
return pan to the broiler. Broil until carrots and onions
begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle salt, garam
masala (or any prepared curry powder), and cayenne, and use
tongs to mix evenly. Because vegetables will shrink as they
cook, use a spatula to move them in from the edges of the
pan, removing empty space between them, and forming a nice,
even rectangle. Return pan to the broiler; broil until
cabbage is tender, and is charred to your liking, a few
minutes more. Transfer into a bowl, and dress with honey,
vinegar, and more salt if needed. Stir in olive oil and
green onions. Serve warm, room temperature, or cold.
