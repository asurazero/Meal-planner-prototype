Coconut Chicken Tenders


Ingredients
1 pound boneless chicken breast tenderloins or skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch thick strips
3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
3 tablespoons flour
1 large egg
1 1/2 teaspoons riracha
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sweet chili sauce
1 tablespoon riracha

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F
(230 degrees C). Place a wire rack in a 18x13-inch rimmed
baking sheet. Coat rack with nonstick cooking spray.
Sprinkle chicken tenders with 1/2 teaspoon salt, set aside.
Place flour in a small shallow dish. Whisk together egg and
Sriracha in a second shallow dish. Combine panko, shredded
coconut, sesame seeds, paprika, garlic powder, and remaining
1/4 teaspoon salt in a third shallow dish. Drizzle panko
mixture with olive oil and mix until coated evenly. One at a
time, dip chicken tenders into the flour, shaking off the
excess, then dip into the egg mixture to coat. Dredge in the
panko mixture, coating all sides and pressing as needed to
help it adhere. Place on the prepared rack. Repeat with
remaining chicken tenders. Bake in the preheated oven until
chicken is cooked through (165 degrees F or 74 degrees C)
internal temperature) and golden brown, about 15 minutes. In
a small bowl mix together mayonnaise, Asian sweet chili
sauce, and Sriracha. Serve chicken tenders hot with dipping
sauce and enjoy!
