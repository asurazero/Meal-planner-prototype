Pork Tenderloin with Peaches


Ingredients
3 slices bacon
1 (2 pound) package pork tenderloin
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
¾ teaspoon ground ginger, divided
1 ½ cups vertically sliced onion
1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
2 cups peeled and sliced fresh peaches
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons frozen orange juice concentrate
1 teaspoon fish sauce
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp,
about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
Reserve drippings in the skillet. Dry pork tenderloin with
paper towels and season both sides with salt, pepper, and
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger. Increase heat to medium-high and
brown tenderloin in the bacon drippings on all sides, 5 to 7
minutes. Removed browned tenderloin from skillet, transfer
to a plate, and keep warm. Reduce heat to medium. Add onion
slices to the same skillet and stir until onions are soft
and beginning to take on some color, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in
garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add sliced
peaches, chicken broth, orange juice concentrate, and
remaining ground ginger. Bring to a boil and return
tenderloin to the skillet. Pile peaches on top of the meat,
cover, reduce heat to simmer, and cook until pork is
slightly pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-
read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Arrange pork and peaches
on a serving platter. Meanwhile, combine fish sauce, water,
and cornstarch in a small bowl and stir until there are no
lumps. Increase heat to medium and bring skillet contents
back to a boil. Add cornstarch mixture to the liquid in the
skillet and stir quickly until sauce is bubbly and
thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over pork and
peaches. Crumble up cooked bacon and sprinkle over the
peaches. Garnish with parsley, if desired, and serve warm.
