Feta and Spinach Stuffed Chicken Breasts


Ingredients
4 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (10 ounce) package spinach
2 ounces feta cheese
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons green onions
1 tablespoon garlic
1/2 teaspoon dried dill

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C). Pat chicken dry using paper towels. Cut a
horizontal slit in the thickest part of each chicken breast
to create a pocket, making sure not to cut all the way
through. Stir together paprika, salt, oregano, garlic
powder, onion powder, pepper, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in
a small bowl until combined. Rub chicken with paprika
mixture until evenly coated. Stir together spinach, feta,
lemon juice, scallions, garlic, and dill in a medium bowl
until blended. Stuff each pocket with 1/4 cup of the spinach
mixture. Close pockets with wooden picks. Heat remaining 1
tablespoon oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Add
chicken, and cook until spices toast and darken, 3 to 4
minutes per side. Transfer skillet to preheated oven, and
cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into
thickest portion of chicken registers 165 degrees F (74
degrees C), about 15 minutes. Remove and discard wooden
picks.
