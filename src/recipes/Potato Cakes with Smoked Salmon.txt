Potato Cakes with Smoked Salmon


Ingredients
3 potatoes
1/2 yellow onion,
1 green onion
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons flour
2 ounces smoked salmon,
1 teaspoon Old BayÂ®
2 tablespoons oil
1/4 cup sour cream, or as needed, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Add grated potatoes, onions and white part of green onion to
a large mixing bowl. Stir in eggs and flour until combined.
Set a small amount of salmon aside for garnish, then stir in
salmon and Old Bay seasoning. Heat oil in a cast iron
skillet over medium heat. Add potato mixture by spoonfuls to
the skillet, and flatten with a spatula to make patties.
Leave space between potato cakes; you may have to fry in
batches. Cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Garnish with remaining smoked salmon, green part of green
onion, and sour cream.
