Pecan Pie Upside Down Cake


Ingredients
nonstick cooking spray
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup light corn syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla paste
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups pecan halves
1 (15.5 ounce) box butter
1 (3.5 ounce) package vanilla pudding
3 large eggs
1 cup milk
1/2 cup oil
1/4 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla paste

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a
10-inch cake pan with nonstick cooking spray. Line with
parchment paper and spray again. Set aside. Place butter,
brown sugar, corn syrup, vanilla paste, cinnamon, and salt
in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Add
pecans and stir until pecans are coated in mixture. Pour
into prepared cake pan and set aside. For cake batter, place
cake mix, eggs, pudding mix, milk, oil, sour cream, and
vanilla in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat for 3
minutes. Pour over pecan mixture. Bake in the preheated oven
until a skewer inserted in center comes out clean, 40 to 50
minutes. Run a butter knife around outside of cake to
release from pan. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.
Carefully flip cake onto a serving platter and cool
completely before slicing.
