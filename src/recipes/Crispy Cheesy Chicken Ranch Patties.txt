Crispy Cheesy Chicken Ranch Patties


Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 large eggs
3 tablespoons onion
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (1 ounce) packet dry ranch dressing mix
3/4 cup mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Cooking Instructions

Combine chicken, eggs, onion, parsley, mozzarella, and half
of ranch seasoning packet in a large bowl. Add 1/2 cup
mayonnaise, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Stir in
flour just until mixture comes together. Preheat the oven to
200 degrees F (93 degrees C). Place a rack inside a sheet
pan and set in the oven while it preheats. Heat 1 1/2
tablespoons oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-
high heat. Working in batches, spoon about 1/4 cup of
chicken mixture into skillet for each patty. Cook,
undisturbed, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip and
cook until golden brown and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes
more. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center
will read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Repeat with
remaining oil and chicken mixture. Place cooked patties on
the prepared pan in the oven to keep warm. Combine remaining
mayonnaise and remaining ranch seasoning in a small bowl.
Add lemon juice and cayenne and stir until well combined.
Serve chicken patties with ranch sauce.
