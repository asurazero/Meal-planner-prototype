Baked Sweet and Sour Chicken Thighs with Pineapple


Ingredients
3/4 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/3 cup onion chunks
1/3 green bell pepper,
1/3 red bell pepper,
1/3 cup pineapple chunks
1/3 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons brown sugar, or to taste
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
1 large clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ginger paste
1 green onion, sliced, or as needed (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly
grease a baking dish or spray with cooking spray. Pat
chicken thighs dry with a paper towel, cut into 1-inch
chunks, and add to the dish. Sprinkle with cornstarch, and
toss until chicken is coated. Stir in onions, green and red
bell peppers, and pineapple. Add ketchup, rice vinegar,
brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger paste to a small
bowl, whisk until well combined, and stir into the chicken
mixture. Bake until chicken is no longer pink at the center
and juices run clear, 14 to 17 minutes, stirring halfway
through. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the
center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). If sauce is
a bit thick, stir in a splash of water to thin out until you
reach your desired consistency. Garnish with green onion
slices and serve.
