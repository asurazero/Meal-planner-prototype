Roscoe's Chicken 65


Ingredients
2 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs
1/4 cup fresh curry leaves
1 cup plain yogurt
1 tablespoon garlic
1 tablespoons ginger
2 tablespoons Kashmiri hot chili powder
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon turmeric
1 tablespoon garam masala
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon cardamom
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 cup cornstarch
1 cup rice flour
1 cup chili peppers
2 cups vegetable oil

Cooking Instructions

Mix chicken, curry leaves, yogurt, garlic, ginger, chili
powder, turmeric, garam masala, salt, coriander, cardamom,
and black pepper together. Cover and let marinate in a
refrigerator for 2 hours or up to overnight. Stir cornstarch
and rice flour into chicken and yogurt mixture just before
preparing to fry chicken. Heat oil in a deep pan over medium
heat. Add chicken pieces and chili peppers carefully into
the hot oil, working in batches, and fry, stirring
frequently, until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes.
Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat
with remaining chicken pieces.
