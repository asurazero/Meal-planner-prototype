Split Pea Soup


Ingredients
2 ¼ cups dried split peas
2 quarts cold water, plus more as needed
1 ½ pounds ham bone
2 onions, thinly sliced
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch dried marjoram
3 stalks celery, chopped
3 carrots, chopped
1 potato, diced

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Place peas in a large stockpot and
cover with several inches of cold water; let soak, 8 hours
to overnight. Drain, rinse, and return peas to the pot. Add
2 quarts of cold water, ham bone, onion, salt, pepper, and
marjoram to the stockpot. Cover, bring to a boil, and simmer
for 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally. Remove ham bone; cut
off meat, dice, and return meat to soup. Add celery,
carrots, and potatoes. Cook slowly, uncovered, until
vegetables are tender, about 30 to 40 minutes. Serve and
enjoy!
