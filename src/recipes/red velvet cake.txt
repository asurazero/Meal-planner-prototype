red velvet cake


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease
two 12-cup muffin pans or line with 20 paper baking cups.
Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer
until light and fluffy. Mix in eggs, buttermilk, red food
coloring, and vanilla. Stir in baking soda and vinegar.
Combine flour, cocoa powder, and salt; stir into the batter
just until blended. Spoon batter into the prepared cups,
dividing evenly. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops
spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in
the pan set over a wire rack. When cool, arrange the
cupcakes on a serving platter and frost with desired
frosting.
