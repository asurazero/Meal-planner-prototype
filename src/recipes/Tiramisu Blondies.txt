Tiramisu Blondies


Ingredients
1/2 cup unsalted butter,
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons espresso powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 extra-large egg,
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon coffee liqueur
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 cup confectioner's sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon heavy cream
4 ounces mascarpone cheese
1 tablespoon cocoa powder

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line an
8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have
overhang on all sides. In a large bowl, whisk together
melted butter, brown sugar, white sugar, espresso powder,
and salt until thoroughly combined. Add in egg, 2 teaspoons
vanilla, and coffee liqueur and whisk until mixture is
combined and lightens in color slightly, about 1 minute.
Whisk in flour and baking soda until just combined. Pour
batter into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bars begin to slightly
pull away from the edges of the pan, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove from oven and allow bars to cool completely in the
pan. For frosting, beat butter in a bowl with an electric
mixer until smooth. Add confectionerâ€™s sugar, vanilla, and
salt and beat until completely smooth and incorporated. Add
heavy cream; beat for another 2 minutes. Add mascarpone, and
mix on low speed until just combined. Spread frosting evenly
over the cooled bars. Sprinkle cocoa powder evenly over the
top of frosting. Refrigerate bars to firm up frosting, about
30 minutes. Remove bars from pan, cut into 16 bars, and
serve.
