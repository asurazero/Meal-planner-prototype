Vanilla Crème Brûlée


Ingredients
3 large egg yolks
Â¼ cup superfine sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla bean paste
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon superfine sugar

Cooking Instructions

Place egg yolks in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer on
high speed until eggs are thick and light yellow, about 5
minutes. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup sugar and vanilla bean
paste. Pour cream into the top of a double boiler over
simmering water and simmer until just hot to the touch,
about 3 minutes. Pour 1/2 of the warmed cream into the egg
mixture, a little at a time, whisking constantly so eggs do
not curdle. Pour egg yolk-cream mixture into the remaining
cream in the double boiler. Cook over medium heat, stirring
continuously, until mixture thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Do
not let mixture boil. Pour custard into 4 small ramekins and
refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours, up to 24 hours.
Sprinkle each crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e with some of the remaining
tablespoon of superfine sugar. Use a blowtorch to melt the
sugar on top of the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. It will crystallize as it
hardens. Alternatively you can use the oven broiler, but be
careful to not burn the sugar. Lightly tap the crystallized
sugar with the back of a spoon to break it before eating.
