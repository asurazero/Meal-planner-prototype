Meatball Subs on a Stick


Ingredients
12 wooden skewers
1 pound 5 ounces lean ground beef
1 large egg
7 tablespoons Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 red onion,
4 teaspoons garlic paste
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 teaspoon red chili flakes (optional)
24 1 inch) cubes mozzarella cheese
1 (12.4 ounce) can pizza crust dough, such as Pillsbury
5 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon garlic paste
1 tablespoon fresh parsley
1 cup marinara sauce,

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
(190 degrees C). Place skewers in water to soak. Line a
sheet pan with parchment paper. For meatballs, combine beef,
egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, onion, garlic paste,
salt, oregano, parsley, basil, and chili flakes in a large
bowl until evenly mixed. Weigh out 1.13 ounces of mixture
and form it around 1 mozzarella cube. Roll in hands to
ensure a tight seal. Place meatball on prepared pan; repeat
with remaining mozzarella and meatball mixture to make 24
balls. On a lightly floured cutting board or other work
surface, roll out pizza dough. Slice into 12 even strips.
Place 2 meatballs on the work surface and coil 1 strip
around them, alternating sides to form an S. Use finger tips
to hold down the first meatball and gently insert the skewer
through it and the dough, twisting the skewer slightly until
it comes out the other end. In a separate bowl, combine
melted butter, garlic and parsley. Using a pastry brush,
brush the butter mixture over dough. Bake in the preheated
oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve with warmed
marinara sauce.
