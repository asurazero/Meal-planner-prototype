Chocolate Cereal Breakfast Bars


Ingredients
1 ½ cups rolled oats
1 cup puffed brown rice cereal
½ cup chopped raw almonds
⅓ cup shredded coconut
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
tiny pinch cayenne pepper
⅓ cup packed brown sugar
½ cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon water

Cooking Instructions

Gather all your ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 pan with butter and line
with parchment paper. Combine rolled oats, puffed brown rice
cereal, almonds, coconut, cocoa powder, salt, and cayenne in
a bowl. Combine brown sugar, maple syrup, vegetable oil, and
water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-
high heat. Stir, and let the mixture boil for 1 minute. Pour
sugar mixture over the dry ingredients in the bowl and mix
thoroughly. Transfer to the prepared pan, and smooth out the
top, pressing lightly with a spatula. Bake in the preheated
oven for 25 minutes. While still hot, use a spatula to score
the pan into 8 portions. Let cool to room temperature before
breaking into bars. You can also not score, and simply let
cool, then cut with a knife. Serve and enjoy!
