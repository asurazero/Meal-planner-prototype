1 large egg
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup onion
2 tablespoons finely chopped dried tomatoes
2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon I talian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pound ground chicken
2 1/4 cups reduced sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup white wine

1/2 teaspoon I talian seasoning
1 (16-ounce) package shelf-stable potato gnocchi

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. For meatballs, preheat the oven to
375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 15x10x1-inch baking
pan with parchment paper. Combine egg, bread crumbs, onion,
2 tablespoons dried tomatoes, milk, 1 tablespoon Parmesan
cheese, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning, salt and
pepper in a bowl. Add chicken, mix well. Shape mixture into
20 1 1/2-inch meatballs. Place in the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until set and lightly browned
(they donâ€™t have to be done at this point), about 15
minutes. Add meatballs to a 3 1/2- to 4-quart slow cooker.
Add broth, cream, wine, 1/3 cup dried tomatoes, and 1/2
teaspoon Italian seasoning. Cover and cook on Low 6 hours or
on High 3 hours. If using Low, turn to High. Add gnocchi.
Cover and cook 20 minutes. Stir in spinach and Parmesan
cheese. Serve hot and enjoy!
