Twice Baked Chicken Pot Pie Potatoes


Ingredients
4 usset potatoes
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2/3 cup heavy whipping cream
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 teaspoons chicken stock base
1 1/2 cups rotisserie chicken
1 1/2 cups carrots and peas
2 tablespoons fresh parsley
2 teaspoons fresh thyme
1 teaspoon garlic
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200
degrees C) with a rack positioned in the center. Pierce
potatoes all over with a fork and place on a large rimmed
baking sheet lined with aluminum foil . Rub potatoes all
over with olive and sprinkle evenly with 1 teaspoon of the
salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Bake in preheated oven
until skin is crispy, and a fork can easily be inserted into
centers of potatoes, about 1 hour. Let cooked potatoes sit
at room temperature until cool enough to handle, about 10
minutes; reserve baking sheet with foil. Cut cooled potatoes
in half lengthwise and scoop flesh into a large bowl,
leaving about 1/8-inch border around the edges; place potato
skins, cut side up on reserved baking sheet; set aside. Add
heavy cream and butter to potatoes, mash until fully
combined. Stir in chicken, carrots and peas, parsley,
bouillon base, garlic, thyme, 1/4 cup of the Cheddar cheese,
remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until
evenly combined. Divide chicken mixture evenly between
reserved potato skins (about 1/2 cup each) and sprinkle
evenly with remaining 3/4 cup cheese. Bake at 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C) until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
Increase oven temperature to broil (do not remove baking
from oven), and broil until cheese is browned, 3 to 5
minutes; garnish with additional parsley.
