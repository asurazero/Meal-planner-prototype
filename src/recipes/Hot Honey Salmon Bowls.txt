Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Bring water and quinoa to a boil in
a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer
until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes; drain any excess
water and set aside. Whisk honey, paprika, garlic powder,
onion powder, cayenne, and 2 tablespoons water together in a
small bowl; set aside. Meanwhile, fill a large skillet with
1 inch of water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add
green beans. Cook, covered, until beans are just tender, 2
to 3 minutes. Drain; set aside. Wipe out skillet; heat olive
oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Season salmon
pieces with salt. Add salmon to skillet; cook until fish
flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes, turning after 2
minutes. Remove salmon from skillet, set aside. Add honey
mixture to skillet. Cook and stir until mixture is bubbly
and slightly thickened; about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from
heat. Return cooked salmon to skillet. Toss to coat in honey
sauce; set aside. For mustard dressing, whisk together olive
oil, vinegar, Dijon mustard, parsley, dill, honey, pepper
and salt, in a small bowl. To serve, divide quinoa evenly
between 2 bowls. Top with hot-honey-sauced salmon, green
beans, cucumber, tomatoes, and red onions and/or olives.
Serve with with mustard dressing.
