Balsamic Braised Pork Tenderloins with Fresh Figs


Ingredients
2 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloins
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 shallots, thinly sliced lengthwise
12 fresh figs, stemmed and halved
1 cup chicken broth
¼ cup good-quality balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
fresh rosemary sprigs for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pat
tenderloins dry and remove silver skin, if present. Season
with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste. Pour
oil into a large, oven-proof skillet and heat over medium-
heat until oil shimmers. Carefully place seasoned
tenderloins into the hot oil and brown on all sides, 7 to 10
minutes total. Add sliced shallots around tenderloins and
stir, about 1 minute. Add figs, chicken broth, and balsamic
vinegar. When the mixture begins to bubble, sprinkle minced
rosemary over everthing. Cover, place in the preheated oven
and bake until pork is no longer pink in the center, 25 to
30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Using
tongs, remove pork from the skillet and place on a serving
platter. With a slotted spoon, remove figs from the skillet
and place around the tenderloins. Cover loosely with foil.
Place skillet back onto the stovetop over medium-high heat.
Bring pan juices to a boil and allow to reduce to about 3/4
cup, 10 to 15 minutes. Slice tenderloins, drizzle reduced
liquid over the meat, and garnish with fresh rosemary
sprigs, if desired.
