Red Velvet Pots de Crème


Ingredients
3/4 cup whole milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 large egg yolks
4 1/2 ounces semisweet chocolate (62% cacao
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon food coloring,
1/4 cup cream cheese
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon confectioners sugar
1 tablespoon cream cheese
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
cocoa powder, for dusting

Cooking Instructions

For pots de crÃ¨me, whisk together milk, cream, and egg yolks
in a saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly with a spatula over
medium heat, until the mixture is hot and steamy, but has
not begun to simmer yet. An instant read thermometer
inserted into the mixture should read 160 degrees F (71
degrees C). Remove from heat, add chocolate, and swirl pan a
few times to settle chocolate down. Let sit for 2 minutes.
Add salt, vanilla, and red coloring. After 2 minutes, add
cream cheese, and whisk everything until smooth. If cream
cheese is not mixing in completely, use a stick blender to
mix for a few seconds. Transfer mixture into serving glasses
or jars. Place jars on a tray and tap each one gently a few
times to bring any air bubbles to the surface. Cover with
plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until cold and
firm, at least 2 hours or up to overnight. For whipped
topping, add heavy cream, confectionerâ€™s sugar, cream
cheese, and vanilla to a bowl, and whisk until medium-stiff
peaks form. Add to a piping bag, and pipe (or spoon) over
chilled pots de crÃ¨me. Dust lightly with cocoa powder, and
serve.
