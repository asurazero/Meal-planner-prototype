Lemon Turmeric Crinkles


Ingredients
3/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons lemon zest
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
4 ounces cream cheese
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup confectioner's sugar

Cooking Instructions

Combine white sugar and lemon zest in a small bowl, and rub
lemon zest into sugar with your fingertips or the back of a
spoon until sugar is moist and pale yellow; set aside. Whisk
olive oil and turmeric together in a large bowl; let stand
for about 1 minute. Whisk in sugar mixture, cream cheese,
egg, and vanilla extract and continue whisking until very
smooth and light, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in baking soda and
salt. Add flour; mix with a spatula just until flour
disappears. Cover and refrigerate until dough firms up and
is no longer sticky, at least 30 minutes and up to
overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees
C). Line baking sheets with parchment. Place confectioner’s
sugar in a shallow bowl. Scoop dough with a cookie scoop (1
1/2 tablespoon); drop each cookie in confectioner’s sugar
and roll gently to coat generously with sugar. Add each
cookie ball to the prepared baking sheets, spaced well
apart. Bake in the preheated oven until very crinkly and
slightly golden on the bottom, 13 to 15 minutes. Tops should
look fairly dry. Cool completely on the pan before serving.
