This Whole Roasted Chicken Recipe is The G.O.A.T.


Ingredients
1 (3 pound) whole chicken
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup butter,
10 sprigs thyme
1/2 lemon
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Pat
chicken dry with paper towels. Season heavily with salt and
pepper, on the outside and inside the cavity. Stuff the
cavity with 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter and thyme sprigs.
Squeeze 1/2 lemon into the cavity and drop lemon half
inside. Rub the remaining 1/4 cup butter underneath the
skin. Rub the skin with 1 tablespoon olive oil or additional
melted butter. Place chicken on a wire rack in a roasting
pan. Bake chicken, uncovered, in the preheated oven until an
instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of
the chicken reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C),
about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and baste with
drippings. Allow to rest for about 30 minutes before
serving.
