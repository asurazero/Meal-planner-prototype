Salmon Sushi Bake


Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds salmon filet
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cups sushi rice,
2 3/4 cups water
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
8 ounces imitation crab,
8 ounces cream cheese,
1 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons Sriracha, plus more to taste
2 teaspoons soy sauce
3 large sheets nori
2 teaspoons furikake
2 teaspoons everything bagel seasoning
2 teaspoons lime juice
2 green onions, or more to taste
1 avocado

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment or foil. Place salmon on the
baking sheet; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, lemon
pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Drizzle oil over salmon.
Bake in the preheated oven until salmon just starts to flake
easily with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool slightly
before breaking up into small pieces. Reduce oven
temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Meanwhile,
combine rice, water, and remaining salt in a sauce pan.
Bring to a boil, stir once, reduce heat to low, and cover.
Cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 12 to 14
minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and fluff with a fork.
Stir in rice vinegar and let cool. When salmon is cooled,
add it to a bowl with crab, cream cheese, 1/2 cup
mayonnaise, 1 1/2 tablespoons Sriracha, and soy sauce, and
stir to combine. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish; add
rice and press into an even layer. Crush nori sheets over
rice and sprinkle with furikake. Spread salmon mixture over
seaweed; sprinkle evenly with everything seasoning. Bake at
400 degrees F (200 degrees C) until browned around the
edges, about 25 minutes. Stir remaining 1/2 cup mayonnaise,
remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons Sriracha, and lime juice
together. Drizzle over casserole before serving; top with
green onions and avocado.
