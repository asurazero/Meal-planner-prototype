Cherry Torte with Cherry Prosecco Syrup


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups cherry juice
1/2 (750 ml) bottle Prosecco
1 1/4 cups white sugar, divided
1 large egg
1 (10 ounce) bag bing cherries, thawed, divided
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon butter

Cooking Instructions

For syrup, pour cherry juice, Prosecco, and sugar into a
saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce
heat and cook at a lively simmer until syrupy and reduced by
at least half, about 40 minutes. Set aside 1 cup cherries
for cake; add remaining cherries to syrup; allow to cool.
Syrup can be made several days in advance. Preheat the oven
to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a 9x9-inch square
baking pan with parchment. Stir sugar and egg together in a
bowl. Stir in the reserved 1 cup cherries. Add flour, baking
soda, salt, vanilla, and butter and stir until flour
disappears. Spread into the prepared baking pan. Bake in the
preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center
comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. The cake will collapse in
the center; this is expected. Cool on a wire rack to room
temperature. Cut cake into squares, and spoon a generous
amount of syrup with cherries over each serving. Cake and
syrup are best served warm or at room temperature.
