Harissa Baked Salmon


Ingredients
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 pound wild salmon fillet
salt and pepper to taste
4 thin slices lemon
2 thin slices sweet onion, separated into rings
⅓ cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon harissa
¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon white wine

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Coat the
inside of a 9x12-inch baking dish with vegetable oil. Place
salmon fillet into the baking dish; sprinkle with salt and
pepper. Arrange lemon slices and onion rings on the salmon.
Mix mayonnaise, lemon juice, harissa, and smoked paprika
together in a bowl until well combined; spread on top of
salmon, lemon, and onion slices. Drizzle orange juice and
wine around salmon. Bake in the preheated oven until salmon
is hot and has begun to turn opaque, 10 to 12 minutes.
Remove the baking dish from the oven, set a broiler rack
about 5 inches from the broiler, and turn the broiler on.
Broil the fish until nicely browned, about 3 minutes.
