Rhubarb Almond Muffins


Ingredients
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup oil
1 large egg
1/4 cup white sugar,
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/3 cups rhubarb

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a
12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. Whisk
milk, oil, egg, white sugar, brown sugar, and almond extract
together in a bowl. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt
together in a separate bowl. Make a well in the center; pour
in the milk mixture and stir until just combined. Fold in
rhubarb. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling
each 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick
inserted near the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
Sprinkle the tops with sugar while hot.
