Chef John's Roman-Style Chicken


Ingredients
6 large chicken thighs
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 yellow onion, sliced
4 cloves garlic,
1 tablespoon capers
1 anchovy filet
1 cup white wine
2 cups crushed tomatoes
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon paste
3 orange bell peppers, seeded and cut into 3/8-inch strips
3 slices prosciutto, cut into strips
chopped Italian parsley (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Use a sharp knife to make 2 cuts through the skin in the
center of the thigh, down to the bone, about one inch apart
from each other. Once cut, transfer thighs into a mixing
bowl. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons olive oil, and season with
salt, black pepper, cayenne, and dried herbs. Use tongs to
toss until very thoroughly coated. Wrap and refrigerate
chicken for at least 2 hours, or up to 12 hours. Preheat the
oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Heat remaining olive
oil in a large oven-safe skillet on medium-high heat. Add
chicken, skin side down, and cook until a deep golden brown
crust has formed, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn chicken over and cook
for 3 minutes more. Turn off heat, remove chicken to a
plate, and set aside. Turn heat back on to medium, and add
onions. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes or until the
onions just begin to soften. Make a space in the center of
the pan, and add garlic, capers, and anchovy. Cook for about
1 minute, while stirring and smashing with the edge of a
wooden spoon or spatula. Pour in wine, and raise the heat to
high. Cook, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes until
the wine reduces by about half. Add the tomato and water and
stir to combine. Return mixture to a boil, and cook,
stirring occasionally, until liquid reduces slightly, 3 to 4
minutes. Add sliced peppers, and mix in evenly. Scatter
about 3/4 of prosciutto slices evenly over the top. Place
chicken thighs back on top, spaced evenly, skin side up.
Place remaining prosciutto slices between chicken pieces.
Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked
through and the top is nicely browned, 40 to 45 minutes. Top
with parsley and serve immediately on olive oil mashed
potatoes, rice, or pasta.
