Country Ham and Biscuits


Ingredients
1/4 cup shortening
3 cups flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup butter
1 1/4 cups whole buttermilk
1 teaspoon bacon grease
3 slices country ham
softened butter, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an
8-inch cast-iron skillet with shortening. In a large mixing
bowl or the bowl of a food processor, sift together flour,
sugar, baking powder, salt, and cream of tartar. Mix or
pulse a few times to combine. Cut butter and 1/4 cup
shortening into flour mixture just until you get a crumbly
consistency. Add buttermilk to flour mixture. Gently stir
until just combined, being careful not to overmix. Turn out
dough onto a floured surface. With floured hands, pat dough
to approximately 2-inch thickness. Using a 2 1/2-inch
biscuit cutter, cut out 6 to 8 biscuits. Transfer to greased
skillet. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove
biscuits from oven and let cool 5 minutes. While biscuits
are baking, cook ham: Add bacon grease to a cast-iron
skillet over medium heat. Add ham slices and fry until edges
are brown, a few minutes per side. Remove ham from skillet
and place on a paper towelâ€“lined plate to drain. Cut each
slice in half. To serve, split each biscuit in half, spread
with softened butter, and sandwich with a piece of ham.
