bbq ribs


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Prepare an indirect fire with charcoal in a smoker or grill,
according to manufacturer's instructions. Once the coals get
going, add wood chips. Maintain a temperature of 230 to 260
degrees F (110 to 127 degrees F). Meanwhile, mix paprika,
brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a
bowl until well combined. Spread rub all over ribs, making
sure not to miss any spots. Place ribs on the preheated
smoker or grill on the opposite side of the fire. Cover and
smoke ribs, adding wood chips as needed to maintain
temperature, until rub has set and looks dry, 1 to 2 hours.
Baste with apple juice and continue to cook, basting every
30 minutes, for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours more. Brush BBQ sauce
on both sides of the ribs, and cook for 15 minutes. Brush
again, and cook until meat pulls away easily from the bone,
10 to 15 minutes longer. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63
degrees C).
