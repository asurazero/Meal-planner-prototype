Honey Garlic Pork Tenderloin


Ingredients
1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
3 tablespoons cider vinegar
6 cloves garlic, minced

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
(190 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch baking pan with a wire
rack. Trim silver skin and excess fat from the pork
tenderloin. Combine brown sugar, salt, Chinese five spice
powder, garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper in a
small bowl. Sprinkle tenderloin all over with spice mixture,
rubbing to coat. Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-
high heat. Sear tenderloin until browned on all sides, 8 to
10 minutes. Place tenderloin on the rack in the prepared
pan. Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read
thermometer inserted near the center reads 140 degrees F (61
degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven, tent with
foil, and let rest 10 minutes. Internal temperature will
rise to 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) or higher. Meanwhile
for sauce, heat honey, soy sauce, vinegar and garlic in the
same skillet. Simmer until liquid reduces and thickens,
about 5 minutes. Slice pork and serve with warm sauce.
