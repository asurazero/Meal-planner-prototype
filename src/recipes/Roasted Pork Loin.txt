Roasted Pork Loin


Ingredients
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried rosemary
salt and pepper to taste
2 pounds boneless pork loin roast
¼ cup olive oil
½ cup white wine

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Crush garlic with rosemary, salt, and pepper in
a mortar and pestle to make a paste. Pierce meat with a
sharp knife in several places and press garlic paste into
the openings. Rub pork loin with the remaining garlic
mixture and olive oil. Set into an oven-safe pan. Place pork
loin into the preheated oven, turning and basting with pan
liquids every 30 minutes. Cook until the pork is no longer
pink in the center, 90 minutes to 2 hours. An instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees
F (63 degrees C). Remove roast to a platter and keep warm.
Place pan onto the stove over medium-high heat and pour wine
into it. Heat wine and stir to loosen browned bits from the
bottom of the pan. Simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Slice pork
loin and serve with pan juices.
