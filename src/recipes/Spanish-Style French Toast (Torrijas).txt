Spanish-Style French Toast (Torrijas)


Ingredients
4 cups milk
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 orange, zested
1 lemon, zested
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 whole cloves
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 large egg yolks
2 large whole eggs
4 slices French bread or brioche
1 cup olive oil, or as needed, for frying
4 tablespoons turbinado sugar (raw sugar)

Cooking Instructions

Combine milk, white sugar, salt, orange zest, lemon zest,
cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla in a saucepan, whisk, and
bring to a simmer over medium-heat. Reduce heat to medium-
low and simmer gently for 5 minutes. Strain milk through a
mesh strainer and transfer 2 cups into a shallow dish in
which to soak stale bread; set aside. Transfer remaining 2
cups infused milk into a saucepan to make the custard sauce;
add yolks and whisk thoroughly. Return saucepan to medium-
low heat, and cook, stirring with a spatula and scraping the
bottom constantly, until the mixture gets hot and thickens
enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat;
immediately pour through a fine mesh strainer. Let cool and
refrigerate until needed. Soak stale bread in milk, turning
a few times, until most of milk is absorbed and bread is
saturated. Remove to a pan or plate and refrigerate until
needed. Beat whole eggs in a wide shallow bowl. Coat bread
on both sides in the egg. Pour olive oil, 1/4 to 1/2 inch
deep into a nonstick skillet, and heat over medium heat. Fry
soaked bread in the hot oil until browned and puffed, about
4 minutes per side. When fully cooked, the bread will spring
back when touched in the center. Remove to a plate. Top each
slice with 1 tablespoon turbinado sugar. Use a blowtorch
with a low flame to brûlée the surface. Serve immediately
with custard sauce.
