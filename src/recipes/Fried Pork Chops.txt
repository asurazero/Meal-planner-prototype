Fried Pork Chops


Ingredients
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
½ cup all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon seasoning salt, or to taste
salt and pepper to taste
4 (¾-inch) thick pork chops

Cooking Instructions

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Combine
flour, seasoning salt, salt, and pepper in a paper or
plastic bag. Place pork chops in the bag and shake to coat.
Shake off any excess flour. Fry chops in hot oil until
golden on the outside and juices run clear, 4 to 5 minutes
per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Drain on a wire rack or paper towels before serving. Serve
hot and enjoy!
