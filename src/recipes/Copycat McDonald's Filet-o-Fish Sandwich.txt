Copycat McDonald's Filet-o-Fish Sandwich


Ingredients
canola oil
4 skinless cod fillets
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon corn starch
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 cups panko
4 brioche hamburger buns
4 American cheese slices
2 teaspoons tap water
Tartar Sauce
shoestring fries

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a
large Dutch oven; heat oil over medium-high to 360 degrees F
(182 degrees C). Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (93 degrees
C). Set a wire rack inside a large rimmed baking sheet; set
aside. While oil heats, pat fillets dry with paper towels,
and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Whisk
together egg, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, corn starch, flour,
paprika, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium shallow
bowl until combined. Place panko in another shallow bowl.
Working with one fillet at a time, dip into egg mixture,
flipping to coat all sides and letting excess drip off.
Place in bowl with panko, and coat all sides. Place on a
large plate; repeat with remaining fillets. Gently add 2
fillets to hot oil; fry, gently stirring and flipping
fillets in oil occasionally, until golden brown and crispy,
3 to 5 minutes. Remove fillets from oil using a slotted
spoon, and place on prepared wire rack. Place in preheated
oven to keep warm while repeating frying process with
remaining 2 fillets. Working with 2 buns at a time, place
bottom buns on a large microwavable plate; top each bun with
1 cheese slice. Lightly sprinkle a small paper towel with
water, and place in small microwavable bowl with bottom
buns. Cover plate with an inverted microwavable glass bowl.
Microwave on HIGH until buns are steamy and cheese is
melted, 15 to 20 seconds. Carefully remove buns from plate;
place top buns on the same plate and microwave on HIGH for
10 to 15 seconds. Immediately top bottom buns with a fish
fillet and drizzle 2 tablespoons McDonaldâ€™s Tartar Sauce on
top. Cover with top buns and serve immediately with
shoestring fries. Repeat with remaining buns and fish
fillets.
