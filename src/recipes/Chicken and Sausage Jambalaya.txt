Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya


Ingredients
2 tablespoons canola oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
1 (14.5 ounce can) tomatoes
4 cups chicken stock, or as needed
2 ribs celery,
1 large yellow onion, diced
1 bell pepper
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
2 bay leaves
4 garlic cloves
2 cups tasso or ham steak
1 pound andouille sausage
2 cups long grain rice
1 bunch scallions

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Add
canola oil to a large Dutch oven set over medium heat. Salt
and pepper chicken liberally and sear on both sides until
golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from Dutch
oven. Open canned tomatoes and strain liquid into a 4-cup
measuring cup. Pour in enough chicken stock to total 4 cups;
set aside. Roughly chop tomatoes. Add celery, onion, bell
pepper (the trinity), chopped tomatoes, cayenne, bay leaves,
and garlic to the Dutch oven and stir until combined on
medium heat. Mix in stock with tomato juice, seared chicken,
tasso, andouille, and rice. Bring this to a nice simmer.
Cover the pot. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
Remove the pot from the oven and continue to let jambalaya
steam for an additional 5 minutes. Garnish with scallions
and a few dashes of hot sauce when ready to serve.
