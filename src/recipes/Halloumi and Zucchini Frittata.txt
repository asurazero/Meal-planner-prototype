Halloumi and Zucchini Frittata


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large zucchini, grated and squeezed dry
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
4 large eggs
4 ounces halloumi cheese, sliced

Cooking Instructions

Heat olive oil in a small, ovenproof skillet over medium
heat. Add zucchini and a pinch of salt and cook until soft,
about 5 minutes. Add chopped mint and dill, and cook 1
minute more. Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a small bowl.
Pour into the hot skillet with the zucchini and briefly
stir. Cook without stirring to allow the bottom of the
frittata to set, about 2 minutes. Use a spatula around the
edges of the skillet to ensure that the frittata isn't
sticking as the bottom starts to set. Set an oven rack about
6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's
broiler. Lay the slices of halloumi on the top of the
frittata as the edges start to set. Place the skillet under
the broiler until the top of the frittata is fully set and
cheese is slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Serve
immediately or at room temperature.
