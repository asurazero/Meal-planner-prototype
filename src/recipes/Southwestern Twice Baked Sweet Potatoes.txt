Southwestern Twice Baked Sweet Potatoes


Ingredients
4 sweet potatoes
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons kosher salt
6 slices bacon
2 tablespoons butter
2 chipotle peppers in adobo
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1/4 cup green onion
1/4 cup sour cream
2 3/4 cups pepper Jack cheese,

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with foil or parchment. Rub potatoes evenly
with oil and sprinkle evenly with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.
Pierce potatoes with a fork and place them on the prepared
sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until completely tender,
35 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet
and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until
crisp, about 10 minutes. Reserve 1 tablespoon bacon grease.
Drain bacon on paper towels, chop, and set aside. Cut the
top 1/4 off the top of each potato and scoop out most of the
potato, reserving intact skins with flesh about 1/8-inch-
thick. Add scooped flesh to a bowl with butter, reserved
bacon grease, and remaining salt, and mash until creamy and
only small lumps remain. Stir in chipotles and adobo sauce,
maple syrup, green onions, sour cream, and 1 cup cheese.
Divide filling evenly among potatoes and top each with 1
tablespoon cheese. Return potatoes to the lined baking
sheet. Return to the oven and bake until hot and cheese is
melted, about 15 minutes.
