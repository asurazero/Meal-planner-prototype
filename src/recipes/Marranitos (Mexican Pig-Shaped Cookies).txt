Marranitos (Mexican Pig-Shaped Cookies)


Ingredients
1 ¼ cups packed brown sugar
¼ cup shortening
1 egg
¼ cup milk
1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup unsulfured molasses
1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
6 cups all-purpose flour
1 egg, beaten

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line
cookie sheets with parchment paper. Beat brown sugar and
shortening together in a large bowl with an electric mixer
until smooth. Beat in 1 egg, milk, and vanilla until smooth.
Stir in molasses, baking soda, and cinnamon. Mix in flour
until the dough is stiff enough to roll out. Roll dough out
on a lightly floured surface to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into
cookies using a pig-shaped cookie cutter. Place cookies 2
inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Brush the tops
of the cookies with beaten egg. Bake in the preheated oven
until risen and edges are lightly browned, about 15 to 17
minutes. Cool briefly on cookie sheets; serve warm or
transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
