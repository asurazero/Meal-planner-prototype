Cottage Cheese Blueberry Breakfast Cake


Ingredients
3/4 cup all-purpose flour plus 1 tablespoon for dusting
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup cottage cheese
3/4 cup honey
6 tablespoons coconut oil, melted, or neutral oil of choice
1 tablespoon lemon zest
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups fresh blueberries

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(180 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Line pan with
parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang. Whisk ¾ cup all-
purpose flour, ¾ cup whole wheat flour, baking powder, and
salt together in a large bowl. Combine cottage cheese,
honey, oil, lemon zest and juice, and vanilla in a blender
container. Cover and blend until smooth. Stir eggs into
cottage cheese mixture. Add cottage cheese mixture to flour
mixture; stir to combine. Toss blueberries with remaining 1
tablespoon of flour in a bowl. Fold blueberries into batter.
Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick
inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let
cool in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. Remove from pan and
cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving.
