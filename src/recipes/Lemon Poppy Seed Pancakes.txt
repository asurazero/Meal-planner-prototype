Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes


Ingredients
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon zest, or more to taste
5 teaspoons poppy seeds
1 large egg
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 cup milk
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
lemon wedges

Cooking Instructions

Combine sugar and lemon zest, and stir to combine. Let stand
about 15 minutes. Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and
baking soda together in a separate bowl. Set aside. Add
poppy seeds, egg, and melted butter to the bowl of sugar,
and whisk thoroughly. Add lemon juice, milk, and flour
mixture. Whisk gently just until flour disappears. Let
batter rest for 10 to 15 minutes before using. Heat a
nonstick skillet over medium heat, and generously grease
with melted butter or vegetable oil. Transfer about 1/3 cup
of batter into the pan for each pancake, and cook until a
few bubbles start to pop through the surface, 3 to 4
minutes. Flip and cook the second side 3 to 4 minutes. Serve
immediately.
