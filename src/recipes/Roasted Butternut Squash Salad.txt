Roasted Butternut Squash Salad


Ingredients
1 medium butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
6 slices bacon
1 cup sliced onion
8 cups chopped romaine lettuce
⅓ cup pecans, toasted and chopped
⅓ cup raisins
2 tablespoons maple syrup, or to taste

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Brush cut
sides of butternut squash with olive oil. Wrap each squash
half tightly in aluminum foil. Roast squash halves in the
preheated oven until they begin to soften, about 20 minutes.
Remove squash from the oven and let sit until cool enough to
handle. Remove foil and slice into 3/4-inch thick slices.
Remove skin from each slice and cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Set
aside 8 cups of the cubed squash, reserving any remaining
squash for another use. Place bacon in a large skillet and
cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until
crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove bacon and drain on paper
towels. Add onions to the skillet and cook in the bacon
grease for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 8 cups squash and cook,
tossing occasionally, until onions are soft and beginning to
caramelize, and squash cubes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Place romaine lettuce in a large serving bowl; crumble bacon
on top and add pecans and raisins. Add butternut squash-
onion mixture; toss to combine. Drizzle with maple syrup and
serve warm.
