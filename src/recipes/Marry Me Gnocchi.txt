Marry Me Gnocchi


Ingredients
1/2 pound bacon
1 (16 ounce) package gnocchi
3 cloves garlic
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup shaved Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup sun dried tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes

Cooking Instructions

Place a heavy skillet on the stove; lay bacon slices flat in
the cold pan, without overlapping. Turn the stove to medium
heat. After 5 to 7 minutes, the bacon should start to curl
and brown. Use tongs to flip each slice over. Cook the other
side until as crisp as you like, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove
bacon from the pan; place it on a plate lined with paper
towels to drain excess grease. Once cool enough to handle,
roughly chop bacon. Add gnocchi to the skillet. Do not stir.
Cook for about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic. Saut√© until
fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chicken broth and slowly
pour in cream; stir to combine. Add in Parmesan cheese. Stir
to melt. Stir in bacon, sun dried tomatoes, Italian
seasoning, and red pepper flakes.
