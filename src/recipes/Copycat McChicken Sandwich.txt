Copycat McChicken Sandwich


Ingredients
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch pieces
3/4 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon paprika, divided
2 teaspoons salt, divided
1 cup flour
2/3 cup cornstarch
3/4 teaspoon pepper
6 hamburger buns,
1 1/4 cups club soda
oil for frying, or as needed
shredded iceberg lettuce, to taste
3 tablespoons mayonnaise

Cooking Instructions

Combine chicken, garlic powder, white pepper, 1/2 teaspoon
paprika, and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor. Pulse
until finely chopped and it forms a uniform mixture. Shape
chicken mixture into 6 patties and freeze on a parchment or
wax paper-lined baking sheet for 20 to 30 minutes. Heat oil
to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk together flour,
cornstarch, remaining salt, remaining paprika, and pepper in
a bowl. Lightly coat partially frozen patties in flour
mixture and shake off any excess mixture and set patties
aside. Add club soda to remaining flour mixture in bowl and
whisk to combine. Working 2 to 3 at a time, dip patties into
batter, allow excess to drip off and carefully place into
the hot oil. Fry, while maintaining a temperature of 330 to
350 degrees F (165 to 175 degrees C), until golden brown,
crispy, and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes per batch. Drain
on a wire rack set inside a paper towel lined rimmed baking
sheet. Repeat with remaining patties. Serve patties on buns
with shredded lettuce and mayonnaise.
