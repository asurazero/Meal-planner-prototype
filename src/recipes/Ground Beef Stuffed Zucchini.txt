Ground Beef Stuffed Zucchini


Ingredients
3 large zucchini
1 pound ground beef
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
4 ounces goat cheese with herbs
1 large egg
1/4 cup Italian breadcrumbs
8 ounces tomato sauce
1 1/4 cups water
1/4 teaspoon allspice
grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
chopped parsley (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Scoop the
inside of each zucchini half out to form a well for the
filling. Chop reserved flesh and set aside. Heat a large
nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and
cook, crumbling with a wooden spoon and stirring
occasionally until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon
salt, 3/4 teaspoon of pepper, and onion powder and stir to
combine. Remove from heat and stir in goat cheese until
melted. Stir in reserved zucchini flesh, egg, and
breadcrumbs. Divide meat mixture into prepared zucchini
halves. Stir tomato sauce, water, allspice, and remaining
salt and pepper together in a bowl. Pour mixture into a
9x13-inch baking dish and arrange zucchini side-by-side in
the dish. Cover with foil. Bake in the preheated oven until
zucchini are tender, uncovering during last 10 minutes of
baking, 30 to 40 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and
parsley if desired.
