Tamales Rojos de Pollo (Red Chicken Tamales)


Ingredients
corn husks
1 ¼ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 pinch salt to taste
1 cup mulato chiles, stemmed and seeded
⅓ cup ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded
1 clove garlic
8 cumin seeds
boiling water as needed
½ pound lard
1 pound masa harina
3 cups chicken broth, or as needed
1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
1 ½ teaspoons salt

Cooking Instructions

Place corn husks in a bowl, cover with boiling water, and
soak for a few hours. Drain, place on a work surface, and
cover with a clean, damp towel. Place chicken in a pot,
season with salt, and cover with water. Bring to a boil over
medium-high heat, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until
chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain chicken
and shred with 2 forks. Heat a griddle over medium heat and
toast mulato and ancho chiles until fragrant, 3 to 5
minutes. Place in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Soak
until soft, about 25 minutes. Combine ancho and mulato
chiles, garlic, cumin seeds, and about 1/2 cup of the
soaking water in a blender; blend until a thick, smooth,
mole-like sauce forms, adding more water if necessary. Heat
1 tablespoon lard in a saucepan over medium heat and add the
sauce; cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken and
cook until flavors are combined and chicken is heated
through, about 5 minutes. Place remaining lard in a large
bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add masa
harina, chicken broth, baking powder, and 1 1/2 teaspoon
salt, and beat until all ingredients are well combined. Test
if the masa is ready by dropping a small ball of masa into a
glass of cold water; if it floats, it's ready, if not, keep
working the dough a little longer. Select 1 wide corn husk.
Spread about 2 tablespoons masa mixture onto the the corn
husk, filling it up to 2 inches from the bottom and 1/4 inch
from the top. Add 1 tablespoon of the chicken filling in the
center of the masa mixture. Fold sides of husk together, one
over the other. Fold the bottom of the husk over the seam of
the 2 folded sides. Repeat with remaining husks. Place a
steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just
below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add
tamales with the open side up and cook until filling is
heated through and separates from the husk, about 1 hour.
Let tamales rest for 15 minutes before serving. Editor's
