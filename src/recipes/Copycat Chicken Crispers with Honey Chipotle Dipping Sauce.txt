Copycat Chicken Crispers with Honey Chipotle Dipping Sauce


Ingredients
2 pounds boneless chicken breasts
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
1 1/2 tablespoons hot sauce
4 cups vegetable oil
2 cups flour
2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup barbecue sauce
1 chipotle pepper, finely chopped, plus 1 tablespoon adobo sauce from the can
1/4 cup honey
1/2 teaspoon salt

Cooking Instructions

Cut chicken breasts into strips about 3 inches long. Stir
buttermilk and hot sauce together in a medium bowl. Add
chicken to buttermilk mixture and toss well to completely
cover the chicken. Let stand 30 minutes. Meanwhile, pour
vegetable oil into a large saucepan or very deep skillet to
about 4 inches deep. Heat oil to 350 degrees F (180 degrees
C). In a large shallow dish, whisk together flour, kosher
salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and
baking powder until well combined. Remove each tender from
buttermilk mixture and coat lightly with flour mixture,
shaking off any excess. Return chicken to buttermilk mixture
and finish with a second coat of flour mixture. Set aside on
a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces. Working in
batches, carefully add chicken tenders to hot oil and cook,
flipping occasionally, until crispy golden brown and cooked
through, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels or a wire
rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. For sauce, whisk
barbecue sauce, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, and honey
together in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt. Serve
chicken with sauce.
