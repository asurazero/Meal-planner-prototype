Easy Garlic Knots


Ingredients
10 ounces pizza dough
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/3 cup minced garlic
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons fresh parsley
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
large baking sheet. Roll out dough on a lightly floured
surface to a 10x16-inch rectangle. Cut dough lengthwise into
12 strips. Halve strips to make 24 (8-inch-long) strips. Tie
each strip in a knot. Arrange on prepared baking sheet. Bake
in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
Transfer knots to a large bowl. Drizzle with oil. Sprinkle
with garlic, Parmesan, parsley, crushed red pepper, and
salt. Toss gently to coat.
