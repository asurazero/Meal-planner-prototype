Creamy Brie and Bacon Pasta


Ingredients
8 ounces fettuccini, or other pasta
4 slices bacon
1 onion
4 ounces sliced mushrooms
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 1 (8 ounce) Brie cheese, rind removed
1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
chopped fresh parsley or fresh basil

Cooking Instructions

Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add
fettuccini and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente,
about 12 to 13 minutes, or your preferred doneness. Drain,
reserving 1/2 cup pasta water; set aside. Meanwhile, place
bacon in a large skillet over medium heat and cook on both
sides until brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon
to drain on paper towels, leaving fat in skillet. Break into
bite-sized pieces when cool enough to handle. Add onion and
mushrooms to skillet with bacon fat, stirring occasionally,
and saute until lightly caramelized, about 5 minutes. Add
garlic, and saute for about 30 seconds to a minute. Cut Brie
into small cubes and add to the skillet, stirring to melt
and combine. Add enough pasta water to form a smooth sauce,
and stir in sun dried tomatoes. Add cooked fettuccini to
skillet, toss to combine, and season with salt and pepper.
Sprinkle with cooked bacon, garnish with parsley or basil,
and serve immediately.
