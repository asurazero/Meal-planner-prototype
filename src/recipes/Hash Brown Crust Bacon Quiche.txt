Hash Brown Crust Bacon Quiche


Ingredients
5 medium-sized russet potatoes
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 pinch garlic powder
6 tablespoons butter,
5 large eggs,
4 slices bacon
2 green onions,
1/2 cup sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup heavy cream

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly
grease an ovenproof pie pan. Shred potatoes, then place in a
cheesecloth. Lightly salt potatoes, then wring out as much
water as possible. Pat with a paper towel, then place in a
bowl. Melt 5 tablespoons butter, add to potatoes, and season
with salt, pepper, cayenne, and garlic powder. Add 1 egg to
potatoes, then mix well. Pour into prepared pie pan; press
potatoes into the bottom and up the sides to form a crust,
making bottom crust fairly thin so that it will cook
completely. Place on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated
oven for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk 4 eggs together in a
bowl; season with salt and pepper. Stir in cream and green
onions. Remove crust from oven; reduce the temperature 350
degrees F (180 degrees C). Sprinkle bacon into the crust,
then top with cheese. Carefully pour egg mixture evenly over
cheese carefully. Bake in the preheated oven until a fork
inserted in the middle comes out clean and the quiche is
puffed and golden, about 30 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes
before serving.
