Beef and Bean Tiny Tacos


Ingredients
1 pound ground beef
1 packet taco seasoning
1/2 cup water
48 corn tortilla chips
1 (14 ounce) can refried beans
8 ounces Mexican blend cheese
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1/4 cup 1/4

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a
large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook while
crumbling with a spatula and stirring occasionally until
browned, about 5 minutes. Add taco seasoning and water and
stir, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits
from the bottom. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is
well coated in seasoning. Remove from heat and set aside.
Arrange whole chips on the bottom of 2 rimmed baking sheets.
Spread each chip evenly with a thin layer of refried beans.
Top evenly with taco meat and cheese. Bake in the preheated
oven until cheese is melted, 5 to 7 minutes. As soon as
chips are baked, carefully fold each chip in half to form a
taco shape. Place tacos on a serving platter with taco sauce
for dipping.
