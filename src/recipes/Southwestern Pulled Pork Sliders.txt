Southwestern Pulled Pork Sliders


Ingredients
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 chipotle peppers in adobo
1 tablespoon adobo sauce from the can
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3 cups coleslaw mix
1/3 cup lime juice
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper,
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 1/2 pounds pork
12 slider buns
12 smoked gouda

Cooking Instructions

For slaw, combine mayonnaise, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce,
salt, and cilantro in the bowl of a blender or food
processor. Pulse 4 or 5 times, scrape down the sides of the
bowl, replace the lid, and puree until smooth. Toss with
slaw mix and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C) and line a sheet pan with foil. For pork, in
a microwave-safe bowl, combine lime juice, honey, tomato
paste, cumin, smoked paprika, cayenne, pepper, coriander and
garlic. Stir to combine. Add shredded pork and stir well.
Heat on 50% power until warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile,
place open buns on the prepared pan. Add a slice of smoked
Gouda to the bottom half of each bun; trim any overhang, and
add as a second layer of cheese. Bake buns in the preheated
oven until cheese has begun to melt, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove
from the oven and place 2 tablespoons pork mixture on top of
cheese. Add slaw to taste on each slider, and cover with top
half of bun. Serve immediately.
