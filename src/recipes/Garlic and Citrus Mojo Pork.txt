Garlic and Citrus Mojo Pork


Ingredients
1/2 cup mint leaves
1/2 cup orange juice
1/3 cup oregano leaves
1/4 cup olive oil
8 cloves garlic
2 limes, juiced
4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 1/2 to pounds pork shoulder
1 white onion
1/2 cup water
salt as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine mint, orange juice, fresh oregano, olive oil, garlic
cloves, lime juice, salt, cumin, paprika, pepper, ground
oregano, and cayenne pepper in a blender; blend until
smooth. Poke pork all over with a small sharp knife and
place into a container just large enough to fit the meat.
You can also use a resealable plastic bag. Pour over
marinade and toss to coat. Spoon any excess marinade from
the bottom of the container over the top of the meat before
covering. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. You can
go as few as 6 or as long as 48 hours. Preheat the oven to
300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place onions in a roasting
pan, and make a space in the middle. Place pork in the pan,
fat side up, and transfer the marinade over the onions on
each side. Pour in water. Transfer into the preheated oven
and roast until internal temperature reaches 190 to 195
degrees F (87 to 90 degrees C), about 5 hours. For best
results baste pork occasionally with liquids in the pan. Add
more water if the pan gets too dry. When pork is done,
remove from the oven, and cover with foil. Let rest for 1
hour. Serve by tearing meat apart like for pulled pork, or
by removing large chunks, and slicing.
