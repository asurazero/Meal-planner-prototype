Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup


Ingredients
1 pound bacon, chopped
2 stalks celery, diced
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes
3 tablespoons butter
¼ cup all-purpose flour
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook
over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper
towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease. Cook
celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion
is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic,
and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes,
and toss to coat. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to
the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the
potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to
20 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet
over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly,
1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and
cilantro. Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring
constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream
mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine. Transfer
about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and purée. Return to the
Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve hot and enjoy!
