Bruschetta Chicken


Ingredients
4 8 ounce skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons ranch or Italian salad dressing mix
1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes, halved
2 tablespoons shallot
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons fresh basil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons capers, undrained
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
Parmesan cheese,
lemon wedges, for serving

Cooking Instructions

On a clean work surface, halve each chicken breast
horizontally (parallel to work surface) to make 8 (4-ounce)
cutlets. For marinade, combine olive oil and dressing mix in
a gallon-size resealable plastic bag. Add chicken; seal bag
and turn to coat completely. Chill at least 1 hour or up to
8 hours. Meanwhile, for tomato salad, combine tomatoes,
shallot, lemon juice, vinegar, basil, garlic, capers, salt,
and pepper in a large bowl. Let stand at room temperature up
to 1 hour before serving. Preheat an outdoor grill to medium
heat (350 to 375 degrees F (175 to 190 degrees C)). Remove
chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Oil grill grates.
Arrange chicken on grill. Cook, covered, turning halfway
through, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into
thickest parts of chicken registers 165 degrees F (74
degrees C), 8 to 10 minutes. Serve chicken topped with
tomato salad. Serve with Parmesan and lemon wedges.
