The Crustburger


Ingredients
2 teaspoons butter
1 potato hamburger bun
2 ounces ground beef
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 slice onion
1 slice American cheese
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
2 teaspoons ketchup
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce,
1/4 teaspoon fish sauce

Cooking Instructions

Heat a heavy skillet or griddle over medium heat. Spread
butter over top of bun and bottom of bottom bun and place in
skillet. Press down firmly with a spatula to completely
flatten buns. Cook until toasted on both sides and set
aside. Increase the heat under the skillet to medium-high.
Place meat in a mounded ball into the hot skillet and press
firmly to flatten with a spatula. Gently work the spatula in
a circular motion to form a very thin patty with jagged
edges. Season with salt and pepper. Place onion on top and
cook until browned around the edges. Top with cheese and
cook until cheese melts. Scrape burger from the skillet and
place on top of the bun top. Invert the other bun so that
the inside of the bun is now the outside. Place burger back
in skillet and cook about 1 minute on each side. Stir
mayonnaise, ketchup, hot sauce, and fish sauce together in a
small bowl. Serve sauce alongside the burger.
