Southern Butter Beans


Ingredients
3 slices bacon, chopped
1 yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, sliced
1 teaspoon black pepper
6 cups chicken stock, plus more as needed
1 pound lima beans
1 (14 ounce) smoked ham hock
2 bay leaves
2 thyme sprigs
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon sherry vinegar
thyme leaves, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Place bacon in a large Dutch oven or
large pot, and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally,
until crispy, about 8 minutes. Add onion, garlic, and
pepper; cook, stirring often, until onion is soft and
translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock, beans, ham
hock, bay leaves, thyme sprigs, and salt; bring to a boil
over medium-high. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and
simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender, 2 1/2
to 3 hours, adding stock or water as needed to keep beans
covered by about 1/4 inch. Stop adding liquid during last 30
minutes of cooking so beans arenâ€™t too brothy. Remove ham
hock; pick meat, discard hock, and stir meat into beans.
Remove and discard bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Stir in
sherry vinegar. Divide beans evenly among bowls. Garnish
with thyme leaves and additional pepper.
