Chicken Piccata Meatballs


Ingredients
2 shallots
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup half and half
1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
2 tablespoons finely minced parsley
1 large egg
2 tablespoons capers
1 pound ground chicken
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup white wine
1 1/4 cups chicken stock
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons butter, cut into cubes

Cooking Instructions

Add half of shallots to a large bowl. Stir in Parmesan
cheese, half and half, 1/3 cup bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon
parsley, and egg. Roughly chop 1 tablespoon capers and add
to the bowl; add ground chicken. Season with salt, pepper,
and garlic powder. Mix gently together until everything is
well incorporated. Add remaining bread crumbs to a work
surface or shallow dish. Form chicken mixture into 12
meatballs, rolling each one lightly in bread crumbs to coat
and to help shape the meatballs. Heat oil in a large deep
skillet over medium-high heat. Add meatballs to skillet and
cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides,
about 5 minutes, adding more oil if necessary. Remove
meatballs from skillet and set aside. Add remaining shallot
and capers to the skillet and cook stirring constantly, for
1 minute. Pour in wine and stock and bring to a boil. Return
meatballs to the skillet, reduce heat, and simmer until
liquid is reduced by half, stirring occasionally, to coat
meatballs in the sauce, 6 to 7 minutes. Once sauce is
reduced, move meatballs to one side of the skillet and turn
the heat to very low. Whisk in lemon juice and cold butter,
stirring constantly, until well incorporated and slightly
thickened. Stir in parsley and remove from heat. Toss
meatballs well with sauce and serve immediately.
