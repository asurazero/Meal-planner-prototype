Halloumi Breakfast Sandwiches


Ingredients
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons bell pepper, any color
2 teaspoons onion
salt and freshly ground black pepper
olive oil cooking spray
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 (2 ounce) breakfast sausage patties
2 slices halloumi cheese
2 English muffins, toasted

Cooking Instructions

Add eggs to a small bowl; stir in bell peppers and onion,
and season with salt and pepper. Heat a skillet over medium
heat, and spray with olive oil spray. Place two egg rings in
the skillet, and pour in the egg mixture, dividing equally
between the rings. When eggs are opaque and starting to
solidify, about 8 to 10 minutes, release the egg by running
a knife around the inside of the ring. Flip the egg and cook
about 30 seconds to 1 minute. While eggs are cooking, heat
olive oil in another skillet over medium heat. Cook sausage
patties on one side of the skillet, turning once, until
heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. On the other side of the
skillet, cook halloumi slices until they are just starting
to turn light golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. To
assemble the sandwich, place cheese on the bottom half of an
English muffin. Next, layer egg on the cheese and top with a
sausage patty. Repeat for the second sandwich. Season with
salt and pepper, and serve immediately.
