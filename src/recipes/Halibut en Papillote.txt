Halibut en Papillote


Ingredients
4 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 Meyer lemon, very
4 fingerling potatoes,
8 asparagus spears
2 tablespoons roasted bell peppers
2 (6 ounce) halibut filets
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Tear off
2 pieces of parchment paper, at least 18 inches long. Mash
garlic and butter together in a small bowl with the back of
a spoon. Place 4 lemon slices on each piece of parchment.
Layer with thinly sliced potato and 4 asparagus spears.
Scatter bell pepper over, and top with 1 tablespoon butter.
Place 1 halibut filet onto each stack of vegetables, and add
1 tablespoon butter. Layer on remaining lemon slices. Season
with salt and pepper. To close packets, bring opposite sides
of parchment together directly above fish. Roll down
together tightly until parchment touches packet contents.
Crimp the parchment. Now roll and crimp the other 2 sides of
parchment to create a sealed packet; tuck ends underneath.
Place packets on a baking tray. Bake in the preheated oven
until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes.
Remove from the oven; let packets rest for 2 to 3 minutes
before opening carefully.
