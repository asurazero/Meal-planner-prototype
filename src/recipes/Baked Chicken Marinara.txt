Baked Chicken Marinara


Ingredients
4 (8 ounce) boneless chicken breasts
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce
8 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup torn fresh basil leaves
cooked pasta

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
(190 degrees C) with racks in upper and lower third
positions. Sprinkle both sides of chicken evenly with salt
and Italian seasoning. Heat oil in a deep, large oven-safe
skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until
golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Pour
marinara sauce evenly over chicken and sprinkle with
mozzarella. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake on the lower
third rack in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, the
sauce is bubbling around the edges, and a thermometer
inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 165
degrees F (74 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes. Remove skillet
from oven and remove foil. Increase oven temperature to
broil. Once preheated, return skillet to upper third rack
and broil until cheese is lightly browned in spots, about 2
minutes. Garnish with fresh basil and serve with pasta.
