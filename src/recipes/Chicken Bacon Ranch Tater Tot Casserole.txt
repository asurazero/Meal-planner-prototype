Chicken Bacon Ranch Tater Tot Casserole


Ingredients
cooking spray
1 package frozen potato tots
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 cup sour cream
2/3 cup ranch dressing
1 envelope ranch dressing mix
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
5 cups shredded rotisserie chicken
4 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese
1 1/4 cups cooked and crumbled bacon (about 10 slices)
sliced scallions

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (200
degrees C). Lightly coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with
cooking spray. Spread potato tots on a large baking sheet
into an even layer. Bake in the preheated oven until golden
and crispy, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and set
aside. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
C). While potato tots cook, whisk together cream of chicken
soup, sour cream, ranch dressing, ranch dressing mix, black
pepper, and granulated garlic in a large bowl until
thoroughly combined. Fold in chicken, Cheddar, and 1 cup of
the cooked bacon until fully coated in sour cream mixture.
Transfer chicken mixture to prepared baking dish and spread
it into an even layer. Top evenly with cooked potato tots.
Bake in preheated oven until bubbling around edges, 30 to 35
minutes. Sprinkle evenly with remaining 1/4 cup cooked
bacon; garnish with scallions.
