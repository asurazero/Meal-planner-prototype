all sides, about 8 minutes. When cool enough to handle, core
and roughly chop radicchio and avocado; transfer to a
serving bowl. Stem and (if desired) seed jalape単o. For zhug,
blend jalape単o, juice of grilled lemon, parsley, cilantro,
garlic, coriander, salt, and remaining 4 tablespoons oil in
a blender or food processor until smooth. Add lettuce,
Parmesan, and zhug to radicchio and avocado mixture; toss to
