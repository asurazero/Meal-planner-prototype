Slow Cooker Loaded Chicken and Potatoes


Ingredients
1/2 cup chicken broth
3 1/2 tablespoon ranch dressing mix
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 1/2 pounds new potatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
6 ounces cream cheese
1/4 cup ranch dressing
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese,
bacon to taste
scallions for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients Stir together chicken broth and ranch
dressing mix in the bottom of a 5-quart slow cooker until
combined. Add chicken breasts in an even layer over broth
mixture, followed by an even layer of potatoes. Drizzle with
oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until
chicken is cooked through and potatoes are fork tender,
about 2 hours and 45 minutes on HIGH or about 3 hours and 45
minutes on LOW. Remove chicken breasts from the slow cooker
and place them on a cutting board. Let them cool slightly
for 5 minutes. Coarsely shred the chicken using 2 forks. Add
cream cheese, ranch dressing, and 1 1/2 cups of the shredded
cheese to slow cooker. Cover and cook on HIGH until cheeses
begin to melt and potatoes are fully tender, about 10
minutes. Uncover and stir cheese mixture until just about
fully combined. Add shredded chicken back to slow cooker and
stir until evenly coated in cheese mixture. Divide among 8
shallow bowls. Garnish with remaining 1/2 cup shredded
cheese, top with bacon and scallions. Serve immediately.
