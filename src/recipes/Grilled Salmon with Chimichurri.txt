Grilled Salmon with Chimichurri


Ingredients
2 cloves garlic
1 shallot
1 bunch curly parsley
1 bunch fresh cilantro
4 sprigs fresh dill
2 tablespoons lime juice
3 tablespoons vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 lime, zested
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
8 (3 ounce) salmon filets
2 teaspoons granulated garlic
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

For chimichurri, add garlic and shallot to the bowl of a
food processor and pulse 2 or 3 times. Add herbs, lime
juice, and vinegar. Blend until finely chopped. With the
food processor still running, slowly drizzle in olive oil to
emulsify. Add lime zest, salt, and pepper to taste and blend
until smooth. Stir in red pepper flakes. Refrigerate until
ready to use. Prepare an outdoor grill for direct cooking
over high heat, 450 to 550 degrees F (230 to 290 degrees C).
Generously coat the flesh side of the salmon fillets with
oil and season evenly with granulated garlic, Italian
seasoning, salt, and pepper. Grill the salmon, skin side
down, over direct high heat for 6 to 8 minutes. Turn the
salmon over, close the lid, and cook until fish flakes
easily with a fork, 4 to 6 minutes longer. Transfer to a
platter to rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Slide the salmon skin
from the fillets and serve with chimichurri.
