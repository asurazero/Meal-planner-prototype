White Chicken Chili Pot Pie


Ingredients
1/3 cup salted butter
1 small yellow onion, chopped
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups chicken broth
2 cups rotisserie chicken
1 (15-ounce) can can
4 ounces 1/3-less-fat cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup salsa verde
1 (4-ounce) can green chilis, undrained
1 (9-inch) pie crust (such as Pillsbury

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C). Melt butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet
over medium. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic, and cook,
stirring often, until slightly softened and fragrant, about
2 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until
mixture smells nutty, about 1 minute. Stir cumin, dried
oregano, salt, and black pepper until well combined.
Gradually stir in broth and continue to cook over medium,
stirring occasionally, until thickened and smooth, about 3
minutes. Add chicken, beans, cream cheese, salsa verde, and
chiles. Cook, stirring constantly, until cream cheese is
melted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and spread chicken
mixture in an even layer. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.
While filling cools, unfurl pie crust on a sheet of
parchment paper and roll into an 11-inch circle. Fold dough
edges under to create a 10-inch circle; crimp edges, if
desired. Gently place pie crust over filling in skillet. Use
a paring knife, cut four 1-inch-long slits into top of pie
crust to allow steam to escape. Bake in the preheated oven
until golden brown and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow pie
to cool for 5 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
