Goat Cheese Stuffed Dates


Ingredients
14 Medjool dates
4 ounces garlic and herb goat cheese
1 tablespoon pine nuts
7 slices bacon
14 toothpicks
1/4 cup balsamic glaze

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a paring knife, cut
each date lengthwise through to the middle and remove pit.
Stuff each date with goat cheese, then press 4 to 5 pine
nuts into the cheese. Wrap each date with a piece of bacon
and secure with a toothpick. Bacon should wrap around each
date about 1 1/2 times. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is nearly done, 15 to
17 minutes. Turn on the broiler and place a rack 6 inches
from heat. Broil dates until bacon is browned and slightly
crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from oven and place on a
serving platter; drizzle dates with balsamic glaze.
