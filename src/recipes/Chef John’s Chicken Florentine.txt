Chef John’s Chicken Florentine


Ingredients
1 pound fresh baby spinach
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
4 cloves garlic
1/4 cup shallots or onions
3 tablespoons white wine
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1/2 cup red bell peppers
1 cup heavy cream

Cooking Instructions

Wilt spinach in a large pot over medium-high heat. As soon
as the spinach turns green, quickly transfer to a strainer
and squeeze out most of the water. Transfer to a cutting
board and roughly chop. Reserve until needed. Season chicken
on both sides with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper,
and coat evenly all over with the flour. Add 2 tablespoons
olive oil to a nonstick pan, and heat over medium-high heat.
Place chicken in, and once breasts are sizzling in the oil,
reduce heat to medium. Cook breasts until just cooked
through and a golden brown crust has formed, 4 to 5 minutes
per side. Turn off heat and reserve. Add remaining 2
tablespoons of olive oil and butter to the pan you plan to
serve chicken in (see Chefâ€™s Note). Turn heat to medium-
high, and once butter melts, add garlic, shallots, and a
pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Add wine,
and cook, stirring, until the wine reduces by half, a few
minutes more. Add lemon zest and red peppers, and cook,
stirring for another few minutes. Stir in cream, and bring
mixture up to a simmer. Season to taste with salt, black
pepper, and cayenne. Once cream simmers for a few minutes,
and begins to reduce and thicken slightly, reduce heat to
medium and stir in wilted spinach until evenly combined with
cream sauce. Place chicken back into the pan, and simmer on
medium, until chicken is heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.
Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and another light grating
of lemon zest.
