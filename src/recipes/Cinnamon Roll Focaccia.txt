Cinnamon Roll Focaccia


Ingredients
1/4 cup canola oil,
all-purpose flour
2 (1-pound) pizza dough
1/4 cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
7 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 ounces cream cheese
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon whole milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Evenly coat a 13- x 9-inch baking
pan with 1/4 cup of the oil. On a lightly floured work
surface, using your hands or a rolling pin, press dough
balls into about 1-inch thickness. Stir together 2
tablespoons light brown sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a
small bowl. Sprinkle the top of one dough round evenly with
sugar mixture, place second dough round on top, and knead
together until combined and one ball of dough is formed.
Place dough in the prepared pan, cover with plastic wrap,
and let rest in a warm place for 3 hours, removing plastic
every hour and gently pressing out dough as thin as
possible. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Uncover dough, and spread into an even layer pressing into
the edges of the pan. Grease your hands and make deep
dimples all over the top of the dough with your fingertips.
Drizzle evenly with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and make
dimples all over top of the dough with your fingertips
again. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly risen and
starting to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt 6
tablespoons of the butter in a small saucepan over medium.
Remove from heat, add remaining 1/4 cup light brown sugar
and remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and stir until combined;
drizzle evenly over dough. Return to oven and bake at 450
degrees F (230 degrees C) until well browned and puffed, 8
to 10 more minutes. Meanwhile, combine cream cheese and
remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a bowl and beat on medium
speed with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, about
30 seconds. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating at low
speed until blended, about 30 seconds. Stir in milk and
vanilla until icing is smooth and creamy. Drizzle icing over
hot bread; serve warm.
