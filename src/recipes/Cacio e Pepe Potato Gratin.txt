Cacio e Pepe Potato Gratin


Ingredients
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 small yellow onion
4 garlic cloves
1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes
1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
2 cups pecorino Romano cheese
fresh thyme leaves, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190
degrees C). Heat butter in a large 12-inch high-sided
skillet over medium heat until melted. Add onion and cook,
stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add
garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about
1 minute. Add cream, evaporated milk, and salt and stir. Add
potatoes, separating slices from each other and nestling
potatoes in cream mixture until potatoes are partially
covered. Bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce heat to
medium and simmer, stirring and folding often, for 15
minutes. (Potatoes will be harder to stir at first but will
soften as they cook). Remove from heat. Add Parmigiano-
Reggiano, pepper, and 1 1/2 cups of the Pecorino-Romano;
fold and stir until potatoes are evenly coated in cheeses.
Top evenly with remaining 1/2 cup Pecorino-Romano. Cover
tightly with foil and bake in preheated oven until potatoes
are fork tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove foil and increase
oven temperature to broil. Broil until cheese is golden
brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove and let sit for 10 minutes.
Garnish with thyme and pepper and serve.
