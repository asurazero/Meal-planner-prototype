Garlic Parmesan Chicken Skewers


Ingredients
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons garlic powder
2 pounds boneless chicken breasts
metal skewers

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Lightly coat the
grate with cooking spray. Combine melted butter, Parmesan
cheese, and garlic powder in a medium bowl. Coat chicken
cubes with mixture. Thread chicken cubes onto each skewer.
Grill until chicken is no longer pink at the center and
juices run clear, turning skewers every few minutes, 15 to
20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the
center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
