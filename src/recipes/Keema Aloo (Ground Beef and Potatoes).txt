Keema Aloo (Ground Beef and Potatoes)


Ingredients
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 extra-large onion, chopped
2 tablespoons water (Optional)
2 pounds lean ground beef
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root
1 serrano chile pepper, finely chopped
2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 ½ teaspoons salt
1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
3 potatoes, peeled and diced
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup frozen green peas
1 teaspoon garam masala

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan
over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until soft
and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. If browned bits of
onion are stuck to the bottom of the pan, add water and stir
to loosen. Stir ground beef, garlic, ginger, serrano chile,
and cilantro into the pan; cook and stir until beef is
browned and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat to
medium-low. Stir in coriander, salt, cumin, cayenne pepper,
and turmeric; cook and stir until flavors blend, about 5
minutes. Add potatoes and tomatoes; cover and simmer until
potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in green peas
and cook until sauce has slightly thickened and flavors have
blended, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle garam masala over top,
cover, and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
