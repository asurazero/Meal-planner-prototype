Skillet Meatballs


Ingredients
1 pound ground beef
1 large egg, beaten
1 tablespoon milk, or as needed
1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
1/2 onion
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3 tablespoons oil
2 tablespoons butter

Cooking Instructions

In a small bowl, beat egg, and add in 1 tablespoon milk.
Stir in panko breadcrumbs; let stand for 1 minute to soften
slightly. Add ground beef. Place onion in the bowl of a food
processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add onion,
Parmesan, garlic, salt, and pepper to the bowl of ground
beef. Using clean, gloved hands, combine mixture gently. If
mixture feels tough, add 1 tablespoon milk. Shape mixture
into 1 1/2-inch meatballs. Heat oil and butter in a heavy
skillet over medium heat. Place meatballs in a single layer,
without crowding, into the skillet, and cook, turning and
moving them around every 2 or 3 minutes, until well browned
on all sides and no longer pink at the center, 10 to 14
minutes, adjusting temperature as needed. An instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
160 degrees F (71 degrees C). You may have to cook meatballs
in batches. Remove meatballs to a foil-lined drip tray.
Serve with pasta and sauce if desired.
