Beef Miso Ramen


Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) beef sirloin steak
Â½ cup gluten-free soy sauce (tamari)
1 teaspoon coconut oil
4 cups beef broth
2 teaspoons miso paste
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a
lid. For best flavor results, marinate in the refrigerator
for 2 hours. Remove steak from the marinade and shake off
excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Heat coconut oil in
a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until
firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4
minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for
medium-rare. Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10
minutes. While the steak is resting, combine broth, miso
paste, garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium
heat; bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil, add
ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper. Transfer broth and noodles to 2
bowls. Slice steak and place on top.
