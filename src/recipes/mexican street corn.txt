Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 370 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Separate out 1/2 cup corn and set aside; pour remaining corn

cream, and mayonnaise. Pulse until mixture is incorporated.
Pour contents of the food processor into a mixing bowl. Add
reserved 1/2 cup corn, onion, cheese, cilantro, lime juice,
chili powder, salt, and granulated garlic. Mix well. Place a
perforated parchment liner into the air fryer. Using a
scoop, place 2-tablespoon dollops of fritter mixture into
the basket. Air-fry fritters for 12 minutes, flipping at the
halfway mark. Sauce: Mix sour cream and lime juice together.
