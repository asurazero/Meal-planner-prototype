Easy Churro Cronuts


Ingredients
2 (8 ounce) cans crescent dough sheets
4 cups oil
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon
chocolate sauce or chocolate hazelnut spread for serving

Cooking Instructions

Remove dough from each can and unroll to a rectangular
shape. Fold the shorter end of 1 sheet up 1/3 of the way.
Fold the opposite edge 1/3 of the way to fold over (and
cover) the first fold. The dough should have 3 layers. Use a
3-inch cutter to cut 3 circles from the dough. Form the
scraps into another layered piece and cut out one more
circle. Repeat with the remaining dough sheet. Use a smaller
cutter to cut the center out of each circle to form a donut
shape and reserve for donut holes. Fill a large saucepan
halfway with oil and place over medium-high heat to reach a
temperature of 350 to 365 degrees F (175 to 183 degrees C).
Line a tray with paper towels. Combine sugar and cinnamon in
a shallow dish; set aside. Working with 2 to 3 cronuts at a
time, carefully lower each cronut into the hot oil. Fry
about 1 minute, rotating occasionally, until browned evenly.
Drain briefly on the prepared tray. While donuts are still
hot, coat evenly in cinnamon sugar. Repeat with remaining
cronuts and doughnut holes. Serve with chocolate sauce or
hazelnut spread for dipping.
