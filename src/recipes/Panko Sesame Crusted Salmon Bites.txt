Panko Sesame Crusted Salmon Bites


Ingredients
1 pound salmon fillet
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons lime juice,
1/2 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)
1/2 cup toasted sesame seeds
cooking spray
2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce
1 teaspoon honey

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Sprinkle salmon evenly with 1/2
teaspoon salt. Whisk together granulated garlic, 1/4 cup
mayonnaise, 1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons soy
sauce, 1 teaspoon lime juice, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon
salt in a bowl. Add salmon to mayonnaise mixture and gently
toss to coat. Stir together panko, sesame seeds, and 1
teaspoon sesame oil in a shallow bowl. Working in 4 batches,
dredge salmon in panko mixture, gently pressing to adhere,
and transfer to a large plate or baking sheet. Lightly coat
the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place half of
salmon in basket, spaced at least 1 inch apart. Cook at 400
degrees F (200 degrees C) until browned and an instant-read
thermometer inserted into the thickest part of salmon
registers 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), about 5 minutes.
Transfer cooked salmon to a plate, and repeat with remaining
salmon. While salmon cooks, stir together chili garlic
sauce, honey, remaining 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1 1/2 teaspoons
soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil, and 1/2 teaspoon
lime juice in a small bowl. Drizzle chili garlic mixture
over cooked salmon and serve with lime wedges.
