Air Fryer Chicken Quesadillas


Ingredients
2 cups shredded cooked chicken
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
2 cups grated cheese (see Note)
16 wooden toothpicks
olive oil cooking spray

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C),
according to manufacturerâ€™s guidelines. Toss chicken with
chili powder, cumin, and cayenne in a bowl. Place a tortilla
on a work surface and cover half the tortilla with about 2
tablespoons grated cheese. Top with 2 tablespoons chicken
mixture, then top with 2 additional tablespoons grated
cheese. Fold tortilla in half and use wooden picks to hold
the tortilla halves together. Spray both sides of the filled
tortilla with olive oil spray. Air fry quesadillas in a
single layer until tortillas are lightly browned and cheese
is melted, about 4 minutes per side. You may have to cook in
batches. Serve warm with your favorite toppings.
