Bodacious Broccoli Salad


Ingredients
8 slices bacon
2 heads fresh broccoli, chopped
1 ½ cups sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
½ large red onion, chopped
⅔ cup mayonnaise
¼ cup red wine vinegar
⅛ cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Place bacon in a large, deep
skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until crisp and evenly
browned, 8-10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate
and crumble when cool enough to handle. Combine bacon,
broccoli, cheese, and onion in a large bowl. Whisk
mayonnaise, red wine vinegar, sugar, pepper, salt, and lemon
juice together in a small bowl. Pour over salad and toss to
combine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
