Cheesy Corndog Casserole


Ingredients
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup chopped celery
3/4 cup green onion
8 hot dogs
1 cup milk
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons mustard
2 teaspoons hot sauce
2 (8 ounce) packages corn bread mix, such as Jiffy
8 ounces Cheddar cheese,

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a
3-quart baking dish. Heat butter in a skillet over medium-
high heat until melted. Add celery and onions and cook until
softened, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Add
hot dog pieces to the same skillet and cook until browned on
all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to mixing bowl with
veggies. Add in milk, eggs, mustard, hot sauce, cornbread
mix, and 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese; stir until combined
(itâ€™s ok if some lumps remain). Pour into the prepared
baking dish. Sprinkle any remaining cheese on top. Bake in
the preheated oven until golden brown and set, 25 to 30
minutes. A toothpick inserted near the center should come
out fairly clean. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
