Chicken and Orzo Bake


Ingredients
6 skinless boneless chicken thighs (1 1/2 pounds)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 cup onion
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons butter
1 pound dry orzo
3 cups chicken broth
1 (5 ounce) package baby spinach
4 ounces armesan cheese, shredded
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes
1 tablespoon lemon zest
2 tablespoons lemon juice
lemon wedges, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees
F (180 degrees C). Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt
and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 5- to 6-quart
Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half the chicken
thighs. Cook until seared and lightly browned, 4 to 5
minutes each side. Transfer browned chicken to a plate.
Repeat with remaining chicken. Reduce heat to medium. Add
remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to Dutch oven. Add onions.
Cook until tender and lightly browned, stirring
occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in minced garlic, cooking
until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add butter to Dutch oven.
Once melted, add orzo, quickly stirring until fully coated
with butter. Carefully pour in chicken broth. Scrape bottom
of Dutch oven with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned
bits. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat. Bake, covered,
in the preheated oven until orzo has absorbed most of the
liquid, about 15 minutes. Remove Dutch oven from oven. Stir
in spinach, Parmesan, dried tomatoes, lemon zest, and lemon
juice. Nestle chicken thighs into orzo mixture. Cover,
return to the oven, and bake until chicken is no longer pink
at the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted near
the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 10
to 15 minutes. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.
