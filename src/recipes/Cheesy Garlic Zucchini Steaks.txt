Cheesy Garlic Zucchini Steaks


Ingredients
1 zucchini
1 pinch salt
2 ounces shredded mozzarella
1 ounce ricotta cheese
2 teaspoons garlic

Cooking Instructions

Cut zucchini in half lengthwise and then in half on the
diagonal. Cut a thin strip off the back of zucchini pieces
to create a flat surface (optional). Place zucchini on a
baking tray. Sprinkle zucchini with salt. Let stand about 15
minutes, then dry cut surface with a paper towel. Preheat
the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir mozzarella
and ricotta together in a small bowl. Dollop on top of the
zucchini. Sprinkle fried garlic on top. Bake in the
preheated oven until zucchini is tender and cheese is
bubbly, about 25 minutes. Serve immediately.
