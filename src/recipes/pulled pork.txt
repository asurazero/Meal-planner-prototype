pulled pork


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Mix together onion, barbecue sauce, celery, water, ketchup,
honey, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, hot pepper
sauce, chili powder, salt, and pepper in a slow cooker until
thoroughly combined. Place pork roast in the center of the
cooker and spoon sauce over top. Cook on Low until pork is
tender and can be easily pulled apart with a fork, 7 to 8
hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
should read at least 195 degrees F (91 degrees C). Remove
pork and shred with 2 forks. Return shredded meat to the
sauce and serve.
