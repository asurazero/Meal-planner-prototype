Boursin Chicken Mushroom and Asparagus Skillet


Ingredients
1 1/2 to 2 pounds chicken tenders
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup shallots
8 ounces mushrooms
2 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
1/3 cup chicken stock
1/3 cup white wine
2 cups asparagus pieces
1 (5.2 ounce) package BoursinÂ® Shallot and Chive Cheese, roughly chopped
fresh snipped chives for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Pat chicken tenders dry with paper towels, and season all
sides with salt and pepper. Melt butter with olive oil in a
large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. When butter is
sizzling, add chicken tenders and cook until browned, 2 to 3
minutes per side. Remove to a plate and keep warm. Add
shallots to the same skillet, and stir for about 30 seconds,
then add mushrooms. Stir until mushrooms begin to soften,
about 2 minutes. Add garlic and herbes de Provence and cook,
stirring, about 30 seconds. Stir in chicken stock and wine.
Add asparagus and another pinch of salt. Place chicken
tenders on top of vegetables, and add any accumulated
juices. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until
chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run
clear, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer,
inserted near the center, should reach 165 degrees F (74
degrees C). Turn off heat, add Boursin, and stir until
melted. Garnish with chives, if desired, and serve warm.
