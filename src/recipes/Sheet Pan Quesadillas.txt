Sheet Pan Quesadillas


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, chopped
2 tablespoons water
1 (1.12 ounce) package fajita seasoning mix
8 flour tortillas
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
4 tablespoons sour cream, for serving
4 tablespoons pico de gallo, or to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat
olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and
bell peppers and cook until they are just beginning to
soften, about 2 minutes. Remove from skillet with a slotted
spoon and set aside. Add chicken to the same skillet and
cook until no longer pink on the outside, about 3 minutes.
Return onion and bell peppers to the skillet. Stir in water
and fajita seasoning. Cook and stir until the chicken has
completely cooked through. On a half sheet pan, place 6
tortillas around the edges of the pan so that about half of
each tortilla hangs over the side. Place another tortilla in
the center to cover the pan completely. Using a slotted
spoon, top with the chicken, onion, and pepper mixture in an
even layer (being careful not to add too much liquid from
the skillet). Finally, sprinkle cheese evenly over the
chicken mixture. Place another tortilla in the center on top
of all fillings, then fold each tortilla over the toppings
towards the center. Place a second half baking sheet on top
of tortillas (this will help the quesadilla hold its shape).
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove the top
baking sheet and continue baking until the tortillas are
golden and crispy, 8 to 12 more minutes. Slice into
rectangles and serve topped with sour cream, pico de gallo,
and cilantro, if desired.
