The Ultimate Croissant Sandwich


Ingredients
2 large croissants
6 slices deli ham
4 (3/4 ounce) slices Havarti cheese
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons honey
1 cup arugula

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with
aluminum foil; set aside. Place bottom of each croissant,
cut side up, on a baking sheet. Layer 3 of the ham slices
and 2 of the Havarti slices over each croissant bottom.
Whisk together olive oil, Dijon, and honey in a small mixing
bowl until fully combined. Evenly brush top half of each
croissant with about 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil mixture.
Place top of each croissant, cut side down, on prepared
baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until Havarti is
melted and ham is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile,
toss arugula and remaining olive oil mixture in a medium
bowl until evenly coated. Remove croissants from oven. Top
melted Havarti layer evenly with dressed arugula and
croissant tops. Serve immediately.
