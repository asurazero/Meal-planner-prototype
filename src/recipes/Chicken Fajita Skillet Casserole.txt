Chicken Fajita Skillet Casserole


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 poblano peppers
1 orange bell pepper
1 white onion
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 1/2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
2 1/2 cups rotisserie chicken
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
2 cups sharp Cheddar cheese
3 cups tortilla chips
lettuce

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat oil
in a large, oven proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add
peppers and onions and cook, undisturbed, 5 minutes or until
browned. Add chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt and
pepper and continue cooking until vegetables are soft,
stirring often, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove vegetables from the
pan and set aside. Add butter to the pan and melt over
moderate heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute,
stirring constantly. Add in tomatoes and broth and cook
until thick and creamy, stirring constantly, about 3
minutes. Stir in chicken and beans. Top chicken mixture with
1 cup cheese. Spread reserved peppers and onions evenly over
the cheese and top with chips and remaining cheese. Bake in
the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned on top,
about 15 minutes. Serve with desired toppings.
