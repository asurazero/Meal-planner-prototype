Ground Pork Tacos with Pineapple Salsa


Ingredients
1 pound ground pork
1 tablespoon soy-based liquid seasoning (such as Maggi® Jugo)
½ teaspoon chipotle powder
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup diced fresh pineapple
¼ cup minced red onion
1 small jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
½ lime, juiced
salt to taste
8 (6 inch) corn tortillas

Cooking Instructions

Combine ground pork, liquid seasoning, ground chipotle
powder, and garlic in a bowl. Set aside briefly for flavors
to meld. Meanwhile, make the salsa: Combine pineapple, red
onion, jalapeño, cilantro, lime juice, and salt in a bowl.
Set aside. Preheat a large skillet over high heat. Crumble
ground pork into the hot skillet. Cook and stir until pork
is completely browned and edges begin to crisp, 7 to 10
minutes. Drain any excess grease. Place pork in a bowl and
keep warm. Wipe out skillet. Warm tortillas in skillet over
medium-low heat, about 20 seconds per side. Divide meat
