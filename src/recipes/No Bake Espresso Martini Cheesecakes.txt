No Bake Espresso Martini Cheesecakes


Ingredients
1 cup dark chocolate chips
20 creme-filled chocolate sandwich cookies
4 tablespoons butter,
1 tablespoon espresso powder
1 tablespoon water
1 1/2 tablespoons cocoa powder,
1 tablespoon coffee liqueur
8 ounces cream cheese,
1/2 cup sugar
1 frozen whipped topping, such as Cool WhipÂ®,
chocolate covered espresso beans,

Cooking Instructions

Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in the
microwave until just melted, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring every
15 seconds. Set aside to cool completely to room
temperature. Pulse cookies in a food processor until fine
crumbs form. Add melted butter and pulse until just
moistened. Divide cookie mixture between 6 martini glasses
or small dessert bowls and refrigerate while filling is
prepared. Stir together espresso and hot water in a mixing
bowl until espresso is dissolved. Add in cocoa powder and
Kahlua and stir until thickened. Add cream cheese and sugar
and beat on medium speed with an electric mixer until smooth
and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add cooled melted chocolate and
mix until just combined. Fold whipped topping into cream
cheese mixture until just combined. Divide mixture among
glasses and smooth the top. Cheesecake is best if
refrigerated for at least 2 hours. Serve with a sprinkle of
cocoa powder and garnish with an espresso bean, if desired.
