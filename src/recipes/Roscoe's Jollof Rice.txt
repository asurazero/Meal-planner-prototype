Roscoe's Jollof Rice


Ingredients
1 (14.5 ounce) can tomatoes
1 red bell pepper,
1 red onion
4 garlic cloves
2 tablespoons fresh ginger
1 jalapeno
1 cotch bonnet pepper, cut in half
1/2 cup palm oil
2 red onions,
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 Maggi
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
3 cups jasmine rice
1 teaspoon thyme, dried or fresh
1 bay leaf
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 cups water

Cooking Instructions

Combine tomatoes, red bell pepper, red onion, garlic,
ginger, red jalapeno, and Scotch bonnet in a blender; blend
until smooth. Heat palm oil in a large Dutch oven over
medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until
softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove onions from the pan. Pour
in tomato base and cook on low until reduced by half. Stir
in tomato paste, turmeric, Maggi cubes, and smoked paprika.
Cook, stirring, until the mixture reduces and becomes an
even deeper red, about 2 minutes. Stir in rice, thyme, and
bay leaf, and season with salt and pepper. Stir in water and
cover with a lid. Cook on low for 35 minutes. Turn off the
heat and let sit covered for 15 minutes. Fluff rice with a
fork, taste and adjust seasonings, and serve.
