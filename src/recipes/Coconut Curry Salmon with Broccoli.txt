Coconut Curry Salmon with Broccoli


Ingredients
4 (6 ounce) salmon filets
2 tablespoons oil
1 tablespoon curry powder,
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon honey
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup shallots
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon ginger
1 pinch red pepper flakes,
1/4 cup Thai red curry paste, or to taste
1 can coconut milk
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon fish sauce
2 cups broccoli florets
1/2 lime
1 tablespoon green onions

Cooking Instructions

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and brush with 1
tablespoon cooking oil. Preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler. Pat
salmon filets dry with paper towels and place on the
prepared pan, skin side down. Brush filets with remaining 1
tablespoon oil. Season filets with curry powder, and season
lightly with salt and pepper. Drizzle honey over the filets,
and place under the broiler. Broil until just crisp on top,
3 to 5 minutes. Watch carefully; honey may burn easily.
Remove from oven and keep warm. For coconut curry sauce,
melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Add shallots and cook about 1 minute, then add garlic and
ginger, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds more, Stir
in red pepper flakes and Thai red curry paste and cook about
3 minutes. Stir in coconut milk, soy sauce, and fish sauce;
bring to a simmer. Add broccoli florets and cook until
crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add salmon filets to the
skillet and simmer until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3
to 5 minutes. Squeeze 1/2 lime over the skillet. Garnish
with chopped chives or green onions, and serve.
