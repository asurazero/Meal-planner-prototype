Orange French Toast Bake


Ingredients
4 large eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup riple Sec
1/2 orange, zested and juiced
1 teaspoon orange extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
12 slices cinnamon raisin bread
1 tablespoon confectioners sugar, or as needed (optional)
2 tablespoons maple syrup, or as needed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly
grease two large baking sheets or line with parchment paper,
lightly sprayed with cooking spray, which will keep the
bread from sticking. In a bowl, whisk eggs until light in
color. Add milk, sugar, orange liqueur, orange juice, orange
zest, orange extract, salt, and nutmeg, whisking until well
combined. Coat bread slices in the egg custard, and place on
the baking sheets without overlapping. Bake until golden
brown, flipping halfway through baking time, about 15
minutes. To serve, sprinkle with confectioners sugar and
drizzle with maple syrup.
