Jiffy Jalapeno Cheese Cornbread Muffins


Ingredients
2 (8.5 ounce) boxes corn muffin mix (such as Jiffy
2/3 cup milk
2 large eggs
1/4 cup sour cream
1/2 cup creamed corn
1/4 cup pickled jalapeno peppers
4 ounces heddar cheese,
1 small jalapeno pepper
softened butter

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12
standard muffin cups or line with paper liners. Combine
muffin mix, milk, eggs, sour cream, creamed corn, pickled
jalapenos, and cheese in a large bowl; stir to combine.
Divide mixture among prepared muffin cups. Place a jalapeno
slice on top of each muffin. Bake in the preheated oven
until browned around the edges and centers spring back
lightly when touched, 17 to 20 minutes. Lightly press down
the center of each muffin to flatten the top slightly right
after taking them out of the oven. Serve topped with butter.
