Roasted Cauliflower Salad


Ingredients
1 medium head cauliflower, cut into bite-size pieces
1 tablespoon olive oil
½ teaspoon salt, or to taste
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
½ cup chopped celery
½ cup raisins
½ cup shredded carrots
½ cup mayonnaise
¼ cup chopped red onion
2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste
⅓ cup toasted chopped pecans
3 strips cooked bacon, crumbled

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (210 degrees C) and line a
12 x 18 inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine
cauliflower pieces, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large
bowl and toss to combine. Spread out seasoned cauliflower in
a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast in the
preheated oven until the edges of the cauliflower begin to
brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to
cool, slightly, about 5 minutes. Combine celery, raisins,
carrots, mayonnaise, red onion, and sugar in the same bowl.
Add roasted cauliflower pieces and toss to coat. Transfer
salad to a serving bowl and garnish with toasted pecan
pieces and crumbled bacon.
