Pistachio Cream Cinnamon Rolls


Ingredients
1 cup mascarpone cheese
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (17.3 ounce) package puff pastry,
1/2 cup chopped pistachio
3/4 cup pistachio cream,
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment or grease a 9x13-inch baking
dish. Combine 1/2 cup mascarpone, white sugar, brown sugar,
cinnamon, melted butter, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a bowl and
mix until smooth. Roll pastry sheets out on a lightly
floured surface. Divide sugar mixture among the 2 sheets and
spread into a thin layer going almost to the edges. Sprinkle
each sheet evenly with chopped pistachios and drizzle each
with 2 tablespoons pistachio cream. Roll each sheet into a
log and place seam side down on the cutting board. Use a
sharp knife to cut each log into 6 pinwheels. Place cinnamon
rolls, cut side up, into the prepared pan. Bake in the
preheated oven until lightly golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, add remaining mascarpone, pistachio cream, heavy
cream, and salt to a bowl and beat with an electric mixer
until smooth. Gradually add powdered sugar and beat until
smooth and slightly fluffy. Spread frosting over warm
cinnamon rolls and sprinkle with additional chopped
pistachios if desired.
