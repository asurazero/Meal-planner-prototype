Loaded Corn Pudding


Ingredients
6 slices bacon
1/2 cup butter
1 (8.5 ounce) box corn muffin mix (such as Jiffy
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1 can creamed corn
3 green onions
1 large egg
1 cup sour cream
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease a 9X13-inch baking dish. Cook bacon in a skillet over
medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 7
minutes. Crumble when cool enough to handle and set aside.
Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon grease. Add reserved bacon
grease to a large bowl; add butter, corn muffin mix, corn,
creamed corn, green onions, egg, sour cream, shredded
cheese, and Cajun seasoning and stir to combine. Pour into
the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until
lightly browned and springs back when lightly touched near
the center, about 45 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before
serving.
