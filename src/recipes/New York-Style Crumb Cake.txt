New York-Style Crumb Cake


Ingredients
4 cups cake flour
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups butter
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an
8x8-inch baking pan; set aside. For crumble, whisk cake
flour, brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon, and salt together
in a bowl. Pour in melted butter. Crumble with your hands
until mixture forms chunks. Let stand for at least 10
minutes for flour to absorb butter. For cake, stir all-
purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in
another bowl until well combined. Add egg, buttermilk, oil,
and vanilla and stir until well incorporated. Spread into
the prepared pan. Add crumble over cake batter by breaking
into large chunks. Bake until a wooden skewer inserted in
the center comes out clean, for 45 to 55 minutes. Cool on a
wire rack for at least 1 hour.
