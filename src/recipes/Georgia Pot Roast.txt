Georgia Pot Roast


Ingredients
1 1/2 to 3 pounds beef chuck roast
1 unce gravy
1 packet ranch seasoning
16 ounce pickled onions
4 cups low sodium beef stock, or as needed
1 tablespoon butter, at room temperature
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

Cooking Instructions

Add chuck roast to a slow cooker (no need to sear it first).
Sprinkle roast with au jus packet, ranch seasoning packet.
Pour pickled onions over roast. Cover the slow cooker; cook
on High for 4 to 6 hours, or on Low 6 to 8 hours. Halfway
through the cooking process, if you need to add some liquid,
add beef stock as needed. When the roast is impossibly
tender and falling apart, remove to shred. Return shredded
beef to the liquid. In a bowl, mash butter with flour to
make a paste; stir butter mixture into beef and liquid to
thicken gravy. Continue to cook for 30 minutes, uncovered.
