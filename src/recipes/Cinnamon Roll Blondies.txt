Cinnamon Roll Blondies


Ingredients
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 ounce cream cheese
7 tablespoons confectioner's sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoons heavy cream

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an
8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have
overhang on all sides. For filling: in a small bowl, mix
brown sugar and cinnamon together until thoroughly combined.
Set aside. For blondies: Whisk melted butter, white sugar,
brown sugar, vanilla, salt, and nutmeg until thoroughly
combined. Add in egg and egg yolk and mix until thoroughly
combined. Add in flour and baking soda and mix until just
incorporated. Spread half the batter into an even layer in
the prepared pan (it will be a somewhat thin layer).
Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the batter.
Place dollops of remaining batter over the cinnamon-sugar
layer, and carefully spread into an even layer to cover
cinnamon-sugar completely. Bake in the preheated oven until
bars begin to pull away from the sides of the pan, are
puffed in the middle, and golden brown on top, 25 to 30
minutes. Allow bars to cool completely in the pan. For
glaze: beat cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt
together with an electric mixer until completely smooth. Add
in heavy cream and beat until smooth. If glaze is too thick,
add more heavy cream a small amount at a time; if glaze is
too thin, add more powdered sugar until desired consistency
is reached. Pour glaze onto cooled bars and spread into an
even layer. Cut into 16 bars.
