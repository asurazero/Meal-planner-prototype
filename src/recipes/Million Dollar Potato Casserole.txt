Million Dollar Potato Casserole


Ingredients
1 (10.5-ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup 4% small curd cottage cheese
4 ounces cream cheese, cubed and softened
1/2 cup sour cream
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, plus more for garnish
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 pounds ukon Gold potatoes (about 6), scrubbed and sliced into 1/8-inch thick slices
2 cups heddar cheese, divided
30 round buttery crackers,
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Add cream of chicken soup, heavy whipping
cream, cottage cheese, cream cheese, sour cream, salt,
garlic powder, and onion powder to a large saucepan over
medium. Cook, stirring often, until cream cheese mixture is
melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in thyme and
pepper. Add potatoes and toss to coat fully. Spoon half of
the potato mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Using the
back of a large spoon, gently press down and spread potatoes
in an even layer; sprinkle with 1 cup of the cheese. Top
with remaining potato mixture, gently pressing down and
spreading potatoes in an even layer. Set aside. Stir
together crackers, butter, and remaining 1 cup cheese in a
small bowl until evenly coated; sprinkle over potatoes.
Transfer baking dish to a large-rimmed baking sheet. Cover
baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven,
until the sauce thickens and potatoes are tender, about 1
hour 40 minutes, removing aluminum foil after 1 hour 10
minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving; garnish with
thyme.
