Pork Chops with Hatch Green Chili Sauce


Ingredients
4 pork chops
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 teaspoon pepper,
2 tablespoons oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 cup onion
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
3/4 cup chicken broth
1 (4 ounce) can green chiles -
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 lime
2 tablespoons cotija cheese
fresh cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Pat chops dry with paper towels. Combine cumin, onion
powder, smoked paprika, salt, garlic, and pepper in a small
bowl. Sprinkle chops on both sides with seasoning blend and
rub into the meat. Pour oil into a large, nonstick skillet
and heat over medium heat until oil shimmers. Swirl the pan
to cover the bottom with oil. Add seasoned chops and cook
until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.
Remove from the skillet and keep warm. For sauce, melt
butter in the same skillet, stirring up any browned bits.
Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about
5 minutes. Stir in flour, making sure all the flour is
coated in oil, and cook until bubbly, about 3 minutes. Add
chicken broth to the mixture and stir until smooth. Add
Hatch chiles and minced garlic, and season with salt and
pepper. Cook until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. Return
chops and any accumulated juices to the skillet, and simmer,
stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. An instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees
F (63 degrees C). Squeeze fresh lime juice over the skillet
just before serving. Serve with cheese crumbles and garnish
with fresh cilantro, if desired.
