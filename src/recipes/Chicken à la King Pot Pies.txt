Chicken à la King Pot Pies


Ingredients
1/3 cup butter
1 (8-ounce) package cremini mushrooms
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
1/3 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 1/2 cups whole milk
1/3 cup water
1 1/2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1/4 cup roasted red peppers
1/2 (17.3-ounce) package puff pastry sheets (1 sheet), thawed
1 large egg
1 tablespoon whole milk
fresh parsley leaves, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Melt butter in a very large skillet over medium heat. Cook
mushrooms and green bell pepper, stirring frequently, about
3 minutes. Add chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until
vegetables are tender and chicken is almost cooked through,
about 7 minutes more. Stir in flour, salt, garlic powder,
paprika, mustard powder, and black pepper. Cook, stirring
constantly, for 1 minute. Stir in 1 1/2 cups milk, hot
water, and bouillon. Increase heat to medium-high and bring
to a boil. Cook, stirring frequently, until thickened and
bubbly, about 3 minutes. Stir in red peppers. Divide mixture
evenly among 6 (8-ounce) ramekins or baking dishes. Preheat
the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Roll out puff
pastry sheet to a 10x15-inch rectangle on a lightly floured
surface. Cut pastry into 6 (5-inch) squares. Top each
ramekin with a pastry square. Whisk together egg and 1
tablespoon milk in a small bowl. Brush pastry with egg
mixture. Arrange dishes on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake
until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 15
minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with
parsley.
