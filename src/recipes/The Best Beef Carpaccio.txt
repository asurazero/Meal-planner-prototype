The Best Beef Carpaccio


Ingredients
1 pound beef tenderloin
1/2 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons lemon juice, divided
2 anchovies
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
4 cups arugula
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup capers
1/2 cup shaved Parmesan cheese
baguette slices for serving (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Wrap beef very tightly in plastic wrap and place in the
freezer until just slightly firm, about 1 hour. Chill 4
large plates in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
Meanwhile, prepare sauce. Combine mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons
lemon juice, anchovies, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in the bowl
of a food processor. Blend until smooth and set aside.
Remove plastic wrap from beef. Using a very sharp knife,
carefully slice paper-thin slices of beef. Arrange beef in a
single layer divided among 4 chilled plates. Toss arugula
with remaining lemon juice and pepper, olive oil, and salt.
Place arugula mixture in the center of the beef. Drizzle
evenly with reserved sauce; sprinkle with capers and cheese.
Serve immediately with baguette slices.
