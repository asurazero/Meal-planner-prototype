1 pound ground beef
2 pounds hash brown potatoes
1 cup corn kernels
1 zucchini
1 cup beef broth
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chilies, (such as Ro-TelÂ® Original)
1 tablespoon taco seasoning, mild or hot
2 teaspoons ground cumin
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup sour cream

Cooking Instructions

Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground
beef, breaking up the pieces as it cooks, until browned and
crumbly. 3 to 5 minutes. Drain off excess fat. Add potatoes,
corn, zucchini, beef broth, RO-TEL, taco seasoning, and
cumin. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover,
reduce heat, and simmer until vegetables are tender, 20 to
25 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Stir in Cheddar,
and allow to melt. Remove from heat. Garnish with dollops of
sour cream and sliced green onions, and serve immediately.
