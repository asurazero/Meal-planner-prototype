Roasted Cauliflower with Feta


Ingredients
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon dried dill
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 large head cauliflower,
2 ounces feta cheese

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Whisk olive oil,
lemon juice, dill, oregano, salt, garlic powder, and pepper
together in a large bowl. Add cauliflower florets and toss
until evenly combined. Let sit for 2 minutes and toss again.
Spread seasoned cauliflower out in an even layer on the
prepared baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until
tender, about 30 minutes, tossing halfway through cook time.
Remove from oven and top with feta cheese.
