Hot Dog Fried Rice


Ingredients
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1/4 cup onion
6 hot dogs, sliced
3 cups cooked rice
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup frozen mixed vegetables
2 tablespoons butter
2 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce, plus more to taste
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon riracha
1 teaspoon lemon juice
3 green onions, thinly sliced

Cooking Instructions

Heat oil over high in a large deep skillet or wok. Add
onions and cook until lightly browned and softened, about 2
minutes. Add hot dogs and cook, stirring constantly until
browned. Add in rice and sesame oil and cook, stirring
constantly, about 1 minute. Stir in ginger, garlic, salt and
pepper. Spread mixture into an even layer and cook,
undisturbed, until rice is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes.
Add in mixed vegetables and stir, then cook undisturbed for
2 minutes. Push rice mixture to the sides and create a space
in the center of the skillet. Add butter to the skillet and
allow to melt. Crack in eggs and cook, stirring only the
eggs until they are soft scrambled. Fold eggs into rice
mixture and stir until evenly mixed. Stir in vinegar and soy
sauce and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat. Combine mayo,
Sriracha and lemon juice in a small bowl. Serve fried rice
topped with a drizzle of mayo mixture and sprinkle with
green onions.
