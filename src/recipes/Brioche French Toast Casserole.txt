Brioche French Toast Casserole


Ingredients
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided
cooking spray
2 cups whole milk
1 cup heavy whipping cream
6 large eggs
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, plus more for serving
1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 (16- oz.) day-old brioche loaf, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 teaspoons granulated sugar

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Stir together brown sugar, flour, melted
butter, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon in a medium
bowl until crumbly; set aside. Lightly coat a 9-x 13-inch
baking dish with cooking spray. Whisk together milk, heavy
cream, eggs, maple syrup, vanilla, and remaining 1 1/2
teaspoons cinnamon in a large bowl until fully combined.
Toss cubed brioche in milk mixture until all pieces are
moistened. (Milk mixture will not be completely absorbed.
Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish, and sprinkle
evenly with granulated sugar. Sprinkle brown sugar mixture
evenly over top of bread mixture. Let casserole stand 10
minutes at room temperature. Bake in preheated oven until
casserole is set and bread is golden brown and puffy, 35 to
40 minutes. Remove from oven, and serve immediately with
additional maple syrup.
