Proper British Fish Cakes


Ingredients
½ cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons capers, drained and chopped
1 tablespoon finely chopped shallot
1 tablespoon finely chopped Italian parsley
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh tarragon
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 pinch cayenne pepper
½ cup milk
1 bay leaf
1 pound cod, cut into 1-inch pieces
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
12 ounces russet potato, peeled and quartered
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon finely chopped Italian parsley
1 tablespoon sliced fresh chives
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
1 large egg, beaten
1 cup panko bread crumbs, or as needed
¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Mix mayonnaise, capers, shallot,
parsley, tarragon, horseradish, mustard, and cayenne
together in a bowl for tartar sauce and refrigerate until
needed. Add milk and bay leaf to a saucepan and place the
pieces of fish over the top. Season with salt. Bring to a
simmer over medium heat, and cook for about 1 minute,
stirring occasionally. As soon as the fish firms up, but
before it starts to flake apart, turn off the heat and
cover. Let sit for 5 minutes before draining. Let cool,
about 10 minutes. Refrigerate until needed. Meanwhile, bring
a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add russet potato
and boil until tender but not falling apart. Drain and mash
potato in a bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, and
cayenne. Add parsley, chives, and lemon zest; add 1
tablespoon tartar sauce mixture. Mix until combined. Flake
chilled fish over the top. Mix until combined. Scoop out ¼
of the mixture and form into a patty. Repeat with remaining
mixture. Dust cakes with flour on both sides. Brush both
sides of cakes with beaten egg. Coat in bread crumbs. Heat
oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry patties in the
hot oil until golden brown and heated through, 3 to 4
minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Serve with tartar
sauce and enjoy!
