Chicken Thigh Curry


Ingredients
6 chicken thighs
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons yellow curry powder
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 red bell pepper
1/2 yellow bell pepper
1/2 green bell pepper
1 yellow onion
4 cloves garlic
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk

Cooking Instructions

Season chicken thighs with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon
curry powder. Heat oil in cast iron skillet to medium heat.
Add chicken thighs to the skillet, and cook, turning
occasionally, until an instant read thermometer inserted
near the center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15
minutes. Remove skillet from heat; remove thighs to a plate
and keep warm. Drain all but about 2 tablespoons oil from
the skillet. Add onions, bell peppers, and garlic and 1
tablespoon curry powder to the same skillet. Set over medium
heat, and cook and stir vegetables for 5 minutes. Stir in
coconut milk, add 1 tablespoon curry powder, and bring to a
simmer. Add chicken thighs to curry sauce, cover skillet
with a lid, and simmer on low heat until thighs are tender,
10 to 15 minutes. Taste; season with more curry powder,
salt, and pepper as needed.
