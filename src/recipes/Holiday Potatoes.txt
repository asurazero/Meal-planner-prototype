Holiday Potatoes


Ingredients
5 pounds russet potatoes - washed, peeled, and quartered
1 ½ teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon garlic paste
8 tablespoons butter
4 ounces cream cheese
½ cup sour cream
1 cup whole milk
2 tablespoons fresh parsley
freshly ground black pepper

Cooking Instructions

Place potatoes in a colander and rinse under cold water
until the water runs clear. Transfer potatoes to a large pot
and fill with enough cold water that potatoes are covered by
2 inches; add 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then lower
heat to medium and cook until fork-tender, about 20 minutes.
Drain potatoes in a colander and transfer to a large bowl or
the bowl of a stand mixer. Add remaining ½ teaspoon salt,
garlic, 6 tablespoons butter, cream cheese, sour cream, and
½ cup milk. Using an electric hand mixer, or in a stand
mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, blend on medium
speed. Pour in remaining ½ cup milk and mix on high speed to
whip potatoes until fluffy. Transfer potatoes to a serving
bowl and top with remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Garnish
with parsley and season with pepper. Buy Now : Good Lookin'
