Apple Butter Meatballs


Ingredients
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 pound ground pork
1/4 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup white onion
1 large egg
1/4 cup milk
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup apple butter
1/4 cup bourbon whiskey
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
salt to taste

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine ground beef,
ground pork, panko, onion, milk, egg, salt, granulated
garlic, and pepper in a large bowl. If mixture is too soft
or wet, place in the refrigerator for 15 to 20 minutes to
firm up before rolling. Shape into 24 meatballs, about 1 1/2
inches in diameter, and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until no longer pink at
the center and browned on the outside, about 20 minutes. An
instant read thermometer inserted into the center of
meatballs should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Meanwhile, prepare apple butter bourbon glaze. In a small
saucepan, whisk together apple butter, bourbon, soy sauce,
maple syrup, and Dijon mustard. Bring to a simmer over
medium-low heat and stir frequently until the sauce is
smooth and just thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove meatballs
from the oven and transfer to a large bowl. Pour glaze over
meatballs and gently toss to coat evenly. Serve warm.
