Cinnamon Buttermilk Bread


Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar,

1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup applesauce
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons unsalted butter

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and
lightly spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray. Whisk
flour, 1 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, 1 1/2
teaspoons cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir
buttermilk, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla together in a cup.
Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients until well
combined. Pour into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the

small bowl with a fork until crumbly. Sprinkle over batter
in loaf pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle
