Classic Swiss Steak


Ingredients
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 pounds round or rump steak
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion
1 green bell pepper
2 carrots
8 ounces sliced mushrooms
2 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes
1 tablespoon fresh parsley

Cooking Instructions

Stir flour, kosher salt, black pepper, paprika, and garlic
powder together in a small bowl. Pound steak with a meat
mallet. Sprinkle meat with flour mixture on both sides and
use the meat mallet to pound the mixture into the meat. Heat
oil in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high
heat until slightly shimmering. Add meat and cook,
undisturbed, until browned and releases easily from the pan,
about 3 minutes. Flip steak and cook for 2 more minutes.
Remove from the pan and set aside. Add onion, bell pepper,
carrots and mushrooms to the drippings in pan; cook and stir
until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in stewed
tomatoes. Return steak to pan, along with any accumulated
juices and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce heat and simmer
until steak is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Sprinkle with
parsley and serve steak and tomato mixture over rice.
