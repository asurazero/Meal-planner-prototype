Easy Grilled Flounder


Ingredients
1 pound flounder
1 1/2 tablespoons buttermilk
1 teaspoon ld Bay
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
cooking spray
lemon slices
flat-leaf parsley sprigs

Cooking Instructions

Clean grates on an outdoor grill. Preheat the grill to 400
degrees F (200 degrees C) and lightly oil the grates.
Prepare fish while the grill is preheating. Pat filets dry
with paper towels and brush each side with buttermilk.
Sprinkle Old Bay seasoning and smoked paprika on each side
of the filets. Spray both sides of the filets with olive oil
spray. When the grill is hot, place the grilling mat on the
grill and place the filets on the mat. Grill until the fish
begins to turn opaque white around the edges, 3 to 4
minutes. If your filet is thicker than 3/4-inch at the
thickest part, more grilling time may be needed. Gently
slide the mat from the grill to a cutting board a little
larger than the fish. Place a serving plate over the fish,
and invert the fish onto the plate, so the grilled side is
up. The fish will finish cooking as it rests, 2 to 3
minutes. Garnish with lemon slices and flat-leaf parsley, if
using.
