Coffee-Rubbed Steak


Ingredients
1/4 cup coffee
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 filet mignon steaks

Cooking Instructions

Combine coffee, brown sugar, chili powder, garlic powder,
paprika, salt, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Set
aside. Let steak come to room temperature. Preheat an
outdoor grill to medium-high. Pat steak dry with paper
towels and season both sides generously with coffee rub.
Place steaks on the preheated grill. Close the lid and cook
for 4 to 5 minutes. Flip steaks and cook until an instant
read thermometer inserted near the center reads 130 to 135
degrees F (54 to 57 degrees C), 4 to 5 minutes more, for
medium-rare. Remove steak from the grill, tent with foil,
and let it rest for a few minutes to allow juices to
redistribute.
