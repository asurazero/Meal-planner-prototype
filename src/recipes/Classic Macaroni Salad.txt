Classic Macaroni Salad


Ingredients
4 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
1 cup mayonnaise
⅔ cup white sugar
¼ cup distilled white vinegar
2 ½ tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1 ½ teaspoons salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
¼ cup grated carrot (Optional)
2 tablespoons chopped pimento peppers (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Bring a large pot of lightly salted
water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water,
stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
about 8 minutes. Rinse under cold water and drain. Mix
mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper, and
macaroni together in a large bowl. Stir in celery, onion,
green pepper, carrot, and pimentos. Refrigerate salad for at
least 4 hours before serving, but preferably overnight.
