Baked Polenta Marinara


Ingredients
3 1/2 cups chicken broth
3/4 cup polenta
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons butter
8 ounces marinara sauce
2 slices prosciutto, shredded

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly
oil a 9x13-inch baking dish; set aside. Bring chicken broth
to a boil in a saucepan, and whisk in polenta and salt.
Immediately reduce temperature to medium, and cook polenta,
stirring continuously, until most of the liquid is absorbed
and polenta is thick, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
Stir Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup mozzarella, and butter into
polenta. Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish and
smooth the top. Bake in the preheated oven until polenta is
fairly firm, about 40 minutes. It will firm a bit more on
standing. Remove polenta from the oven; let stand for 5
minutes. Spread marinara over the top, then sprinkle evenly
with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella. Sprinkle top with
shredded prosciutto. Bake polenta until cheese is bubbling
and golden brown, about 15 minutes more. Let stand for 5 to
10 minutes before serving.
