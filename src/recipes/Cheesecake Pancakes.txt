Cheesecake Pancakes


Ingredients
8 ounces fresh strawberries, hulled and chopped
3/4 cup strawberry jam
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
5 tablespoons white sugar, divided
2 teaspoons milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
cooking spray
Graham cracker crumbs or powdered sugar for topping

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. For topping, combine strawberries
and jam in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer; set aside.
For cream cheese swirl, combine cream cheese, 3 tablespoons
sugar, milk, and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat with an
electric mixer until smooth. Transfer cream cheese mixture
to a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with a corner
snipped off. For pancake batter, combine flour, remaining 2
tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a
large bowl. Combine egg, buttermilk, and oil in a medium
bowl. Add egg mixture all at once to the flour mixture. Stir
just until moistened (batter should be slightly lumpy). Heat
an extra-large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat.
Coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/3 cup portions of batter
onto the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until
bottoms are golden brown and edges are slightly dry and
bubbles form at the edges of the pancakes, 2 to 3 minutes.
Pipe a swirl of cream cheese onto each pancake starting from
the center. Coat the uncooked side of the pancakes with
cooking spray. Turn and cook 2 to 3 minutes more on the
other side. Repeat with remaining batter and cream cheese
mixture. Serve with strawberry topping and sprinkle with
graham cracker crumbs or dust with powdered sugar.
