Seared Chuck Eye Steak


Ingredients
4 (8 ounce) beef chuck steaks
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons butter
sprigs thyme
2 cloves garlic
1 shallot
1/2 cup beef broth

Cooking Instructions

Pat steaks dry with a paper towel. Season generously with
salt and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Place
steaks in the hot skillet and immediately turn down the heat
to medium-high. Cook for 4 minutes. Turn steaks, add 1
tablespoon butter (or more as desired) and thyme sprigs to
the pan, and cook for an additional 4 to 6 minutes,
depending on your taste. Remove steaks from skillet and let
rest, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, make pan sauce: remove
skillet from heat. Quickly saute the garlic and shallot for
1 to 2 minutes in the skillet using residual heat. Return
the skillet to medium-low heat and add beef broth. Bring to
a boil and reduce for 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat and
whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Serve sauce over
steaks.
