Individual Salmon Wellingtons


Ingredients
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 6-ounce skinless salmon fillets
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons fresh oregano
2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
2 teaspoons fresh dill
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 teaspoon fresh thyme
1/2 cup feta cheese
spinach
1 frozen frozen
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
Lemon

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200
degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; set
aside. Pat salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Sprinkle
salt and pepper on both sides of the salmon. Mix mayonnaise,
mustard, oregano, basil, dill, lemon zest, and oregano in a
small bowl. Set aside half the mixture for serving. Spread
remaining mixture on the top of salmon fillets. Sprinkle
feta cheese on top of the salmon. Top with spinach. Cut the
pastry sheet in quarters. Roll each portion on a lightly
floured surface to a 7x7-inch square. Place each salmon
fillet, topping side down, in the center of a pastry
portion. Lift edges of pastry to enclose the salmon. Pinch
edges to seal, and place each bundle, seam-side down, on
prepared baking sheet. Beat together egg and water in small
bowl. Brush egg wash on tops and sides of pastry bundles.
Cut several small slits in tops of each pastry bundle to
allow steam to escape. Bake in preheated oven until pastry
is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve with reserved herb
Dijon mixture and lemon wedges.
