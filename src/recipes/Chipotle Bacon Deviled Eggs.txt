Chipotle Bacon Deviled Eggs


Ingredients
6 large hard-boiled eggs
2 slices bacon
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon n
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder

Cooking Instructions

Halve eggs lengthwise and scoop egg yolks into the bowl of a
mini food processor; set egg whites aside. If you do not
have a mini food processor, you can mash all ingredients in
a bowl with a fork. Mince 1 bacon slice and add to the egg
yolks; cut the other slice into 12 pieces and set aside for
garnish. Add mayonnaise, adobo sauce, dry mustard, and
garlic powder to the egg yolks; blend well until smooth,
scraping down the sides of the bowl. If mixture is too
thick, blend in an extra tablespoon of mayonnaise. Season
with salt and pepper. Place yolk mixture into a resealable
bag and snip off a corner. Pipe mixture into egg whites.
Sprinkle eggs with ground chipotle pepper and top with bacon
pieces. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
