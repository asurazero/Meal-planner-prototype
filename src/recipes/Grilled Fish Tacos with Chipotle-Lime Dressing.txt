1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste

½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound tilapia fillets, cut into chunks
1 (8 ounce) container light sour cream
½ cup adobo sauce from chipotle peppers
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 teaspoons lime zest
½ teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay
¼ teaspoon cumin
¼ teaspoon chili powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 (10 ounce) package tortillas
3 ripe tomatoes, seeded and diced

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Prepare marinated fish: Whisk olive
oil, vinegar, lime juice, lime zest, garlic, honey, seafood
seasoning, hot pepper sauce, cumin, chili powder, and black
pepper together in a bowl until blended. Place tilapia in a
shallow dish and pour the marinade over the fish; cover the
dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours.
Make the dressing: Combine sour cream and adobo sauce in a
bowl. Stir in lime juice, lime zest, seafood seasoning,
cumin, and chili powder. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cover
and refrigerate until needed. Preheat an outdoor grill for
high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set the grate 4 inches
from the heat. Remove fish from the marinade, drain off any
excess and discard the marinade. Grill fish pieces until
easily flaked with a fork, turning once, about 9 minutes.
Assemble tacos: Place fish pieces in the center of tortillas
with desired amounts of tomatoes, cabbage, and cilantro;
drizzle with dressing. To serve, roll up tortillas around
fillings, and garnish with lime wedges.
