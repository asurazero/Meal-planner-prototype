Air Fryer Chicken Parmesan


Ingredients
2 2 (8-ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts, patted dry
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon black pepper, divided
1/3 cup all purpose flour
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups seasoned panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)
1/4 cup armesan cheese, plus more for garnish
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup marinara sauce, plus more for serving
1 cup mozzarella cheese

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. On a cutting board, butterfly
chicken by cutting each breast in half widthwise to create 4
thin pieces of chicken; season both sides with 1/2 teaspoon
of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper. Place
flour, egg, and panko in 3 separate shallow dishes. Add
Parmesan, oil, crushed red pepper, and garlic powder to
panko; stir to coat. Add remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and
remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper to flour; stir to
combine. Working with 1 chicken piece at a time, dredge
chicken in flour; shake off excess. Dip in egg; let excess
drip off. Dredge in panko mixture to coat; place on a plate.
Preheat a 6-quart air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)
for 2 minutes. Working in two batches, add 2 chicken cutlets
to the air fryer basket in a single layer. Cook until
chicken is golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per
side. Top each chicken piece with 1/4 cup marinara and 1/4
cup mozzarella cheese. Snugly fit all 4 breasts in a single
layer in air fryer basket; cook at 400 degrees F (200
degrees C) until cheese is melted and browned and a
thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of chicken
registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes.
