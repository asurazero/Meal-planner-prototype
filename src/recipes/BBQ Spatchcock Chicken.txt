BBQ Spatchcock Chicken


Ingredients
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 (3 1/2 pound) whole chicken
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup vinegar-based BBQ sauce

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (230 degrees C). Mix salt,
cumin, paprika, black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, onion
powder, and ground mustard together in a bowl. Pat chicken
dry with paper towels. Using shears, cut along each side of
the chicken backbone and remove the bone. Turn chicken
breast side up and press the breastbone to flatten the
chicken. Rub chicken all over with olive oil and spice
blend. Transfer chicken to a large cast iron skillet. Roast
in the preheated oven until skin is browned and crispy,
about 30 minutes. Check temperature, and baste with 1/2 cup
of BBQ sauce. Return chicken to the oven and let cook until
an instant-read thermometer reaches 165 degrees F (74
degrees C), about 15 more minutes. Transfer chicken to a
cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Serve with
remaining BBQ sauce.
