Easy Salted Caramel Apple Pull Apart Bread


Ingredients
1 (16.3 ounce) can buttermilk biscuits, such as Grands
2/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon
6 tablespoons butter
2/3 cup apple butter
2 tablespoons caramel sauce or caramel sauce
sea salt, to taste

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease a loaf pan. Split uncooked biscuits in half to form 2
thinner biscuits. Stir white sugar, brown sugar, and
cinnamon together in a shallow bowl. Place melted butter in
another shallow bowl. Lightly coat each biscuit piece in
butter, allowing excess to drip off, and then coat lightly
with sugar mixture. Place one biscuit at the end of the
prepared loaf pan. Spread about 2 teaspoons apple butter on
another biscuit and press it lightly against the biscuit in
the pan. Repeat with remaining apple butter and biscuits to
fill the loaf pan. Apple butter should be sandwiched between
each biscuit piece. Sprinkle any remaining cinnamon sugar
over the loaf. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are
golden brown, risen, and a toothpick inserted in the center
comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan
for 5 minutes before inverting onto a serving platter.
Drizzle with caramel sauce and sprinkle with salt if
desired.
