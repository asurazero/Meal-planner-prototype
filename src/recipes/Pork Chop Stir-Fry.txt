Pork Chop Stir-Fry


Ingredients
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
3 cups small cauliflower florets
2 medium carrots, julienned
1 ½ cups frozen corn, thawed
½ cup frozen peas, thawed
1 pound boneless pork chops, cut into stir-fry strips
2 stalks green onions, thin sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
¾ teaspoon ground ginger
½ teaspoon chili powder
1 cup water
¼ cup soy sauce
4 teaspoons honey
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
2 tablespoons cold water
4 teaspoons cornstarch
¼ cup salted peanuts
3 cups hot cooked rice

Cooking Instructions

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high
heat. Add cauliflower and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Add
carrots and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add corn and peas; cook
until veggies are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Remove all
veggies to a bowl and keep warm. Add remaining 1 tablespoon
oil to the skillet. Add pork and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add
green onions, garlic, ginger, and chili powder; fry until
pork is no longer pink, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from
the skillet and keep warm. Add 1 cup water, soy sauce,
honey, and bouillon to the skillet. Stir 2 tablespoons cold
water and cornstarch together in a small bowl, then
gradually add to the skillet, stirring constantly; bring to
a boil. Cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes.
Return vegetables and pork to the pan; cook until heated
through. Stir in peanuts and serve over hot cooked rice.
