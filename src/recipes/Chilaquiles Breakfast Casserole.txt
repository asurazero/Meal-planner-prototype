Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Add

powder, cumin, oregano, and green onions to a bowl and whisk
thoroughly. Toss Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses together;
set aside. Transfer 1 ladle of sauce into the bottom of a
9x12-inch baking dish. Top with half the chips, arranging
into an even layer. Ladle over half the remaining sauce. Top
evenly with half the cheese mixture. Top with remaining
chips, arranging into an even layer. Ladle over remaining
sauce. Top evenly with the remaining cheese mixture. Bake in
the preheated oven until the casserole is heated through and
cheese is starting to brown, 20 to 25 minutes. In the last
few minutes of baking time, prepare the eggs by frying or
poaching, or bake them on top of the casserole as shown in
the video. See Chef's Note for directions. Serve casserole
hot, topped with avocado, queso fresco, cilantro, sour
cream, and hot sauce. Add a fried or poached egg to the top
of each serving.
