Chicken Bacon Ranch Tacos


Ingredients
6 slices bacon
2 tablespoons smoked paprika
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast
6 (6 inch) flour tortillas
3 tablespoons red onion
1 cup shredded lettuce
1/2 cup pepper Jack cheese
2 plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup ranch dressing, or to taste

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly
oil the grate. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over
medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper
towels. Whisk smoked paprika, onion powder, oregano, and
garlic salt together in a shallow bowl. Coat chicken with
seasoning, and cook on the prepared grill until no longer
pink at the center and juices run clear, about 10 minutes
per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Place
tortillas on the hot grill and heat until lightly grilled,
20 to 30 seconds per side. Slice chicken and place in warm
tortillas. Top with shredded lettuce, red onions, shredded
cheese, and chopped tomatoes. Drizzle with ranch dressing.
Crumble bacon over top. Serve immediately.
