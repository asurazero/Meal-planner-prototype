Roasted Honey Garlic Cauliflower


Ingredients
1/2 head cauliflower
olive oil spray
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup honey
4 garlic cloves
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1 teaspoon riracha sauce
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon cornstarch
sliced scallions, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and line
a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place cauliflower
florets on prepared baking sheet, spray well with olive oil
spray, season with salt and pepper, and toss. Roast until
cauliflower is starting to tenderize, but is still crisp, 17
to 20 minutes. Set aside for 8 to 10 minutes to cool.
Meanwhile, add honey, garlic, hoisin sauce, Sriracha, ginger
powder, and onion powder to a saucepan, stirring until you
reach a low boil. Whisk water and cornstarch in a small
bowl, add to saucepan, stirring constantly. Cook until sauce
starts to thicken, about 2 to 3 minutes. Feel free to adjust
consistency to your preference, but keep in mind that it
will thicken a little more as it cools. Set aside for 5
minutes. Move cauliflower to a large bowl. Drizzle with
sauce, stir until florets are well coated, garnish with
sliced scallions, and serve.
