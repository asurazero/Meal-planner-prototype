Philly Cheesesteak Smothered Tater Tots


Ingredients
1 (2 pound)-package tater tots
1 onion
1/2 green bell pepper
1/2 red bell pepper
1 (12 ounce) box frozen sandwich beef
1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
large baking sheet with foil; arrange tater tots on the
sheet in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven until
golden, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook and stir onion,
green pepper, and red pepper in a large skillet over medium-
high heat for 5 minutes. Add beef, Worcestershire sauce, and
steak seasoning. Cook until most of liquid has evaporated,
about 6 minutes. Divide beef mixture over baked tater tots
with a slotted spoon. Sprinkle shredded cheese over the top.
Bake until cheese is melted and beginning to brown, about 5
minutes more.
