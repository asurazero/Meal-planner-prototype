Pomegranate Glazed Salmon


Ingredients
4 (8 ounce) salmon fillets
1 tablespoon butter
2 teaspoons orange juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups pomegranate juice
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 green onion
1 clove garlic,
1 pound fresh spinach
salt to taste
1 cup pomegranate arils,
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
2 green onions
1/2 orange
1 tablespoon orange zest

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and line a
sheet pan with parchment paper. Place salmon on the prepared
sheet pan and allow to come to room temperature. Stir melted
butter and orange juice together in a small bowl, and brush
on salmon fillets. Season with salt and pepper. Bake salmon
in the preheated oven until an instant read thermometer,
inserted near the center, reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees
C), 13 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, for drizzle, combine
pomegranate juice, brown sugar, orange juice, and salt in a
small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, and
cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture is slightly
thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. For spinach,
pour olive oil into a large skillet, and heat over medium
heat until oil shimmers. Add green onion and garlic and
cook, stirring, until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add spinach and cook, turning the spinach and stirring,
until just wilted and still bright green, about 2 minutes.
Transfer spinach to a serving platter, and place salmon
filets on top. Drizzle salmon with pomegranate drizzle, and
sprinkle with pomegranate arils. Garnish with parsley, green
onions, orange slices, and orange zest.
