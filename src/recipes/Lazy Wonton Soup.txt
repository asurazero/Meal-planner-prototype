Lazy Wonton Soup


Ingredients
2 quarts chicken stock or broth
1 bunch green onions, divided
1 garlic clove, thinly sliced
1 3-inch fresh ginger,
2 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
1 pound ground pork
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
2 teaspoons cornstarch
3 heads baby bok choy
20 wonton wrappers
Sriracha hot sauce

Cooking Instructions

Place chicken stock in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over
medium-high heat. Cut white parts of green onions into
1-inch pieces and add to broth. Add garlic clove. Thinly
slice 1 inch ginger (or 1 teaspoon ground) and add to stock.
Add 1 tablespoon soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar and 1/2
teaspoon salt. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring
occasionally. Place pork in a bowl. Finely slice remaining
green parts of green onions. Set aside 3 tablespoons for
garnish. Add remaining onions to the bowl; grate in
remaining 2-inch piece of ginger. Add remaining soy sauce,
remaining salt, sesame oil, and cornstarch to the bowl; mix
until well combined. Form mixture into 1-inch balls and add
to broth. Alternatively, use a small spoon to drop heaping
teaspoons full of meat into broth. Reduce heat to a simmer;
cook 5 minutes. Add wonton wrappers, bok choy, and
additional soy sauce to taste. Cook 8 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Serve with reserved green onions and hot sauce
or chili crisp if desired.
