Peanut Butter Oatmeal


Ingredients
1 cup 1% milk
1 tablespoon superfine sugar
1 pinch salt
1 pinch cinnamon
1/2 cup oats
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon peanut butter
2 teaspoons honey
1 tablespoon chopped walnuts (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine milk, sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low
heat and bring to a simmer. Add cinnamon and oats. Cook over
medium-low heat until oats are tender with a bite, about 5
minutes. Use a long spoon to stir, and adjust heat to
prevent splattering. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla and
peanut butter. Serve in a large bowl, and top with honey and
walnuts.
