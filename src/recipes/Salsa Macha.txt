Salsa Macha


Ingredients
1 ancho chili pepper
1 Guajillo chili pepper
6 chili de Ã¡rbol peppers
1 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
4 garlic cloves, chopped
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/4 cup peanuts

Cooking Instructions

Remove the stems and seeds from the chili peppers. Chop into
1/4-inch pieces. Set aside. Heat oil over medium heat until
it begins to shimmer. Add sesame seeds and garlic. Cook,
stirring constantly, until sesame seeds are browned and
garlic has crisped up, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Add chili peppers and stir until combined. Let sit at room
temperature until cool, about 10 minutes. Stir in vinegar,
salt, and Mexican oregano. Pour mixture into a food
processor and pulse several times until the salsa is
combined, making sure not to over process. Stir in peanuts.
