Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup


Ingredients
1 pound bacon, chopped
2 stalks celery, diced
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes
3 tablespoons butter
Â¼ cup all-purpose flour
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook
over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper
towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease. Cook
celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion
is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic,
and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes,
and toss to coat. SautÃ© for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to

potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to
20 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet
over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly,
1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and
cilantro. Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring
constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream
mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine. Transfer
about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and purÃ©e. Return to the
Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve hot and enjoy!

Balsamic Braised Pork Tenderloins with Fresh Figs


Ingredients
2 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloins
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 shallots, thinly sliced lengthwise
12 fresh figs, stemmed and halved
1 cup chicken broth
Â¼ cup good-quality balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
fresh rosemary sprigs for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pat
tenderloins dry and remove silver skin, if present. Season

oil into a large, oven-proof skillet and heat over medium-
heat until oil shimmers. Carefully place seasoned
tenderloins into the hot oil and brown on all sides, 7 to 10
minutes total. Add sliced shallots around tenderloins and
stir, about 1 minute. Add figs, chicken broth, and balsamic
vinegar. When the mixture begins to bubble, sprinkle minced
rosemary over everthing. Cover, place in the preheated oven
and bake until pork is no longer pink in the center, 25 to
30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Using
tongs, remove pork from the skillet and place on a serving
platter. With a slotted spoon, remove figs from the skillet
and place around the tenderloins. Cover loosely with foil.
Place skillet back onto the stovetop over medium-high heat.

Best Ever Cuban Sandwich


Ingredients
1/2 white onion
15 cloves garlic
3 oranges
3 limes
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 (5 pound) pork shoulder roast
1/4 cup butter, softened, divided
1 loaf Cuban bread,
2 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard
1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise
8 slices Swiss cheese
2 cups roast pork
12 ounces deli ham
12 sandwich-sliced refrigerated kosher dill pickles

Cooking Instructions

Prepare pork shoulder: Add onion, garlic, orange juice, lime
juice, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and salt into a food
processor or blender and process until smooth. Place pork in
the bottom of a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or large baking
dish and cut 3 or 4 large deep slits in the meat. Pour
marinade over pork, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator
4 hours or overnight. Place Dutch oven with prepared pork,
covered, in the oven and set the temperature to 325 degrees
F (165 degrees C). Bake until pork is very tender, 3 to 4
hours. Remove from the oven; rest 15 minutes. Remove pork to
a cutting board. Skim any fat from the cooking liquid, and
set cooking liquid aside. Shred pork with two forks, and
discard any remaining fat and bone. Return pork to the pot,
and add cooking liquid back into meat as needed to moisten.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat a
large skillet over medium heat. Spread about 2 tablespoons
softened butter over cut sides of bread and place bread,
buttered sides down, in skillet. Cook until buttered side is
lightly browned and toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir mustard
and mayonnaise together in a small bowl. Spread about 2
teaspoons mustard mixture over bottom halves of bread and
top with 1 slice of cheese, tearing as needed to fit the
bread without hanging over the edges. Using tongs or a
slotted spoon, add about 1/2 cup shredded pork to each
sandwich, draining off any excess liquid. Top each evenly
with ham, 3 pickle slices, and 1 cheese slice. Spread
remaining mustard mixture evenly over top pieces of bread
and place on top. Reheat the skillet over medium heat.
Spread about 1 tablespoon butter lightly on the outsides of
the 4 bottom buns. Working 2 sandwiches at a time, place
sandwiches, buttered side down, in skillet. Place 1 or 2
heavy-bottomed skillets on top of sandwiches to weigh them
down. Cook until toasted and lightly golden brown, 2 to 3
minutes. Remove weighted skillets. Spread remaining 1
tablespoon butter over the 4 top halves of sandwiches, flip
and press with weighted skillets again until toasted. Remove
the first 2 sandwiches from skillet; repeat the toasting
process with remaining sandwiches. Cut sandwiches in halves
and serve immediately.

Cherry Cola Ribs


Ingredients
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons mustard
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons cherry cola
1 (3 pound) rack baby back ribs, membrane removed
1 1/2 cups cherry cola
2 tablespoons ketchup
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste

Cooking Instructions

For dry rub, whisk salt, smoked paprika, onion powder,
garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a
small bowl; set aside. For wet rub, whisk mustard, vinegar,
and 2 tablespoons cherry cola together in a small bowl; set
aside. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Line a sheet pan with a piece of foil long enough to extend
past the rack of ribs by at least 6 inches on both ends. Use
large size, heavy-duty foil if possible. Place the ribs,
meat side up, on the foil. Brush wet rub over top and sides,
and sprinkle about 60% of dry rub over the surface. Turn
ribs over and, with the bone side up, brush with wet rub,
then sprinkle with all the remaining dry rub. Reserve any
wet rub left at this point. Center the ribs lengthwise on
the foil, and bring up the ends of the foil, like a boat,
and crimp so any juices will stay inside. Crimp the two long
edges together over the top of the ribs. The foil doesnât
have to be airtight, but the whole rack should be covered.
Bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours. Remove, open the
foil, and pour off juices that have accumulated in the foil
into a saucepan. Turn the rack meat side up, and brush with
wet rub. Enclose again in the foil, and continue to roast at
250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 1 hour. While meat is
cooking, add any remaining wet rub to the juices in the
saucepan, then add the 1 1/2 cups cherry cola, ketchup, and
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a simmer
on medium high, cook until liquid is reduced by half. Reduce
heat further, and simmer liquids very slowly until they
eventually thicken and become sauce-like. Once it is the
thickness of barbecue sauce, remove from heat entirely.
After one hour at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), remove ribs
from the oven, and open out the foil, pressing foil flat to
line the pan. Turn the oven temperature up to 300 degrees F
(150 degrees C). Brush ribs with sauce. Return ribs to the
oven for 15 minutes. Repeat this process, brushing ribs with
sauce every 15 minutes, until ribs are tender and come
easily off the bone, about 1 hour more. (See Note) Let ribs
rest for about 10 minutes. Slice between each rib with a
sharp knife, and serve with extra sauce.

Garlic and Citrus Mojo Pork


Ingredients
1/2 cup mint leaves
1/2 cup orange juice
1/3 cup oregano leaves
1/4 cup olive oil
8 cloves garlic
2 limes, juiced
4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 1/2 to pounds pork shoulder
1 white onion
1/2 cup water
salt as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine mint, orange juice, fresh oregano, olive oil, garlic
cloves, lime juice, salt, cumin, paprika, pepper, ground
oregano, and cayenne pepper in a blender; blend until
smooth. Poke pork all over with a small sharp knife and
place into a container just large enough to fit the meat.
You can also use a resealable plastic bag. Pour over
marinade and toss to coat. Spoon any excess marinade from
the bottom of the container over the top of the meat before
covering. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. You can
go as few as 6 or as long as 48 hours. Preheat the oven to
300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place onions in a roasting
pan, and make a space in the middle. Place pork in the pan,
fat side up, and transfer the marinade over the onions on
each side. Pour in water. Transfer into the preheated oven
and roast until internal temperature reaches 190 to 195
degrees F (87 to 90 degrees C), about 5 hours. For best
results baste pork occasionally with liquids in the pan. Add
more water if the pan gets too dry. When pork is done,
remove from the oven, and cover with foil. Let rest for 1
hour. Serve by tearing meat apart like for pulled pork, or
by removing large chunks, and slicing.

and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over
medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking
constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This
can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk
constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue
whisking until mixture stops cooking. Make the gumbo: Place
celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work
bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are
very finely chopped. Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix
in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat,
and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and set aside. Combine water and beef
bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring
to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes
dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.
Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper
sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes,
and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix
in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.
Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet
over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15
minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the
simmering gumbo. Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire
sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more
minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just
before serving. Serve hot and enjoy!

Japanese-Style Triple-Seared Steak


Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) filet mignon
1 teaspoon avocado oil
3 tablespoons sea salt
1/3 cup Japanese whiskey
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon butter

Cooking Instructions

Before starting the triple-searing process, build a very hot
hardwood charcoal fire. Oak, mesquite or hickory are great
choices. The coals should be glowing red, and radiating
extreme heat before the meat hits the grill. Rub steak all
over with oil. Coat with sea salt until entire surface area
is completely covered. Pour whiskey into a shallow bowl; set
aside. Place steak on hottest spot on the grill, and sear
both sides, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer steak
into bowl of whiskey, and turn constantly for at least 1
minute. Most of the salt will rinse off. Place steak back
onto the hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides
again, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. You can baste steak
with a small amount of whiskey while searing. Add soy sauce
to another shallow bowl. Add steak to the bowl, and turn
constantly for at least 1 minute. Return steak to the
hottest spot on the grill for the 3rd and final sear. Grill
both sides for about 2 1/2 minutes, or until desired
doneness is reached. For a rosy-pink inside, remove when an
instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 118
to 120 F (48 to 50 degrees C). Brush steak with melted
butter, and let rest for 3 to 4 minutes. Slice and serve
with any accumulated juices from the plate.

Prosciutto Plum Focaccia


Ingredients
1 packet active dry yeast
1 cup water
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon white sugar
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
12 slices plum
4 slices prosciutto
2 teaspoons rosemary
1 teaspoon sea salt

Cooking Instructions

Stir yeast and warm water together in a large bowl and let
stand for 15 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, sugar,
all-purpose flour, and salt. Use a wooden spoon to stir
until a very soft, sticky dough forms. While stirring,
incorporate any dough that sticks to the sides of the bowl.
Drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub some on your
hands. Pick up dough, and with your fingers under the dough
pushing gently up, stretch the sides down and under several
times while rotating the dough, in order to form a
relatively smooth ball with some surface tension on top.
Place dough ball into the bowl, smooth side up, cover the
bowl, and refrigerate overnight. The next morning, pull out
dough and let rise at room temperature until doubled in
size, about 1 1/2 hours. Generously oil a work surface with
about 1 tablespoon olive oil, and transfer dough to the work
surface. Press into a large rectangle, and then fold into
thirds one way, and then the other, forming a small
rectangle, about 6x9 inches. Generously oil a sheet pan with
about 2 tablespoons olive oil, and transfer dough rectangle
to the sheet pan. Press dough out to about 1/2-inch thick.
Cover; let proof at room temperature until dough has spread
out, risen slightly, and surface has bubbles, 1 1/2 to 2
hours. Meanwhile, wrap plum sections with prosciutto and
refrigerate until needed. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F
(245 degrees C). Sprinkle dough with rosemary. Push wrapped
plum sections deep into the dough in a 3x4 pattern. Drizzle
top lightly with olive oil; sprinkle with sea salt. Bake in
the preheated oven until browned, 17 to 20 minutes. As soon
as focaccia is out of the oven, brush with more olive oil if
desired. Transfer focaccia to a rack and let cool completely
before cutting.

1 large onion
12 ounces mushrooms
4 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 cup red wine
1 cup beef broth
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup all-purpose flour

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Season

covered, in the preheated oven until meat is fork tender, 1
1/2 to 2 hours. Using a slotted spoon, remove meat and
mushrooms from braising liquid. Place flour in a small bowl
and add about 1/2 cup of water. Whisk briskly until there
are no lumps. Whisk about 1/2 cup of braising liquid into
the flour mixture. Whisk flour mixture into the braising
liquid in the pan. Place pot over medium heat, stirring
briskly, until mixture comes to a boil. Continue to whisk
until bubbles collapse and look like bullseyes, about 3
minutes. Add beef and mushrooms back to the liquid and

Roasted Pork Chops with Zucchini


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup rated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning blend
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 large egg
4 zucchini, quartered lengthwise, then halved crosswise
4 boneless pork chops
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
16 cherry tomatoes (optional)
4 parsley sprigs, or as needed (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and line

yolk are incorporated. Lightly brush each zucchini piece
with egg, and toss with 1/3 of the panko crumb mixture.
Place breaded zucchini on the prepared rack. Dip chops into
beaten egg and hold over the bowl to allow excess to drip
back into the bowl. Place each chop on the reserved panko
mixture, then turn and coat the other side with panko
mixture, gently patting mixture onto each chop. Heat olive
oil and butter together in a large skillet over medium heat
until butter is melted and no longer sizzling. Carefully

turning once, 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning once. Nestle
browned chops on the prepared rack with zucchini pieces.
Roast in the preheated oven until chops are no longer pink
at the center and zucchini is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. An
instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chops
should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove chops from
the oven and place on a serving plate. If desired, broil
zucchini pieces until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. See
Cookâs Note. Garnish with cherry tomatoes and fresh parsley,

1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
pinch cayenne
pinch of cumin
kosher salt
4 pork sausages
1 12 ounce) coleslaw mix
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon jalapeno pepper
1 lime, juiced
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon osher salt
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup reek yogurt
1 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon orcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons peppercorns
Kosher salt to taste
4 pita or naan, warmed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the
trimmed pork tenderloin on a plate or work surface. Combine
olive oil, grated garlic, red pepper flakes, cayenne, and
cumin in a small bowl. Rub the oil and spice mixture all
over the pork, coating the entire surface, then season
generously with Kosher salt. Preheat a coated cast-iron
skillet over medium-high heat, about 2 minutes. Add pork
tenderloin and cook until deeply golden brown, about 5
minutes. Flip tenderloin over and cook for an additional 3
minutes. Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and roast
for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, push tenderloin to one
side of the skillet and add the sausages. Roast for an
additional 10 minutes, flipping sausages halfway through,
until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145
degrees F (62 degrees C). Remove skillet from the oven and
tent with foil to rest for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
combine coleslaw mix, cilantro, apple cider vinegar,
jalapeÃ±o, lime juice, freshly ground black pepper, and salt

evenly mixed. Combine mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, lemon juice,

the seasoning according to your tastes. When ready to
assemble, wrap the pita or naan in foil and place in the
oven while you carve the pork to warm slightly. The oven
does not need to be on, the residual heat from roasting the
pork will be enough to warm the bread. Split the sausages
down the center lengthwise. Carve the pork tenderloin into
1/4-inch thick slices. To assemble, place a warm piece of
pita or naan on a large plate. Set down 4 to 5 slices of
pork tenderloin, and add a sausage on top. place about 1
loosely packed cup of the prepared slaw on top, then drizzle
without about 2 tablespoons of peppercorn sauce. Roll the
wrap up and enjoy.

Sous Vide Maple Chipotle BBQ Pork Chops


Ingredients
1 cup ketchup
Â¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
Â¼ cup apple cider vinegar
Â¼ cup maple syrup
1 large jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon chopped canned chipotle chiles in adobo
1 tablespoon adobo sauce from canned chipotle chiles
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 Â½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1 teaspoon chili powder
Â½ teaspoon onion powder
Â½ teaspoon garlic powder
Â½ teaspoon smoked paprika
4 (1 1/4-inch-thick) bone-in, center cut pork chops
Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Prepare a thermocirculator and water bath according to
manufacturer's directions. Set thermocirculator to 135
degrees F(57 degrees C) (if you want the pork cooked medium
instead of medium-rare, set to 145 degrees F (62 degrees
C)), and allow water bath to come up to temperature. Stir
together ketchup, melted butter, vinegar, maple syrup,
jalapeno, mustard, chipotles, adobo sauce, Worcestershire, 1
teaspoon salt, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder,
and smoked paprika for the sauce in a bowl. You should have
about 2 cups sauce. Season all chops evenly with remaining 1
1/2 teaspoons salt and pepper and place chops in an even
layer in a large vacuum sealable bag. Pour 1 cup of the
sauce into bag. Cover and chill remaining sauce. Massage bag
to be sure each chop is evenly coated in sauce, then seal

Southern Butter Beans


Ingredients
3 slices bacon, chopped
1 yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, sliced
1 teaspoon black pepper
6 cups chicken stock, plus more as needed
1 pound lima beans
1 (14 ounce) smoked ham hock
2 bay leaves
2 thyme sprigs
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon sherry vinegar

pepper; cook, stirring often, until onion is soft and
translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock, beans, ham
hock, bay leaves, thyme sprigs, and salt; bring to a boil
over medium-high. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and

Summer Meat Slaw


Ingredients
1 head green cabbage
1/2 cup green onions
1 red bell pepper
1 large carrot
2 cloves garlic
4 cups pulled pork
1/4 cup avocado oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons riracha
1/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1/3 cup chopped cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Halve and core cabbage; cut each half into 2 pieces, and

green onions, bell pepper, and garlic to a large mixing
bowl. With a vegetable peeler, peel thin strips of carrot
over the top. Place a nonstick skillet over high heat and
add pork. Cook until pork is very hot and a brown crust is
forming on the meat, about 5 minutes. If meat is lean, 1 to
2 tablespoons of oil can be added to the pan as needed. Pour
hot pork over veggies and mix with tongs to combine. Add 2
tablespoons oil to the same pan and place over high heat.
Transfer in cabbage and salt. Cook, stirring, until cabbage
softens and starts to brown in spots, but still retains a
bit of crunch. Add cabbage, black pepper, Sriracha, and rice
vinegar to the bowl; mix slaw thoroughly. Add cilantro, and
mix thoroughly. Taste for seasoning, and adjust salt and
pepper, heat, and vinegar as needed. Serve hot, warm, or at
room temperature, garnished with thinly sliced green onion.
If making ahead, warm slaw before serving.

Tex-Mex Pork Chops and Rice Skillet


Ingredients
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 boneless pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick
2 teaspoons taco seasoning spice blend
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup onion
1 cup green bell pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 (10-ounce) diced tomatoes and green chilies
1 teaspoon chili powder
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
2 cups corn kernels, thawed
2 cups zucchini
1 cup uncooked rice
flat-leaf parsley or cilantro (optional)
lime slices (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Heat olive oil over medium heat in a 12-inch skillet. Season
both sides of pork chops with taco seasoning, cumin, smoked
paprika, and salt. Place chops in the hot skillet and cook,
turning once, until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes
per side. Remove to a plate, and keep warm. In the same
skillet, cook and stir onion and bell pepper, until the
vegetables just begin to pick up a little color, about 2
minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30
seconds. Pour in diced tomatoes and green chilies, with
their juices, and stir, being sure to scrape up any browned
bits on the bottom of the skillet. Add chili powder and
black pepper to the chicken broth, and stir in. Add thawed
corn kernels, sliced zucchini, and uncooked rice. Stir until
vegetables are evenly distributed, and make sure all the
rice is submerged in the cooking liquid. Bring to a boil.
Nestle pork chops into the skillet contents, and add any
accumulated juices from the chops. Cover, reduce heat to
low, and simmer about 20 minutes. Remove cover, and continue
to simmer until rice is tender and all the liquid is
absorbed, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center of pork chops should read 145
degrees F (63 degrees C). Garnish with flat-leaf parsley or
cilantro and lime slices. Serve warm.

Big Fat Fondant Potatoes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon miso paste
1 1/2 teaspoons dashi powder
6 large russet potatoes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2/3 cup chicken broth

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring
chicken broth to a simmer; whisk in miso and dashi. Turn off
the heat; set aside until needed. Turn potatoes onto
narrowest side; trim straight down to create a flat surface.
Turn and trim the other side with a straight cut parallel to
the first. Cut a little off each end to square the potato a
bit more, then make 2 angled cuts on each side of the
squared ends. Transfer to a bowl of cold water. Reserve
trimmings for another use. Drain, and dry with paper towels.
Place a large cast-iron pan or other heavy ovenproof skillet
on high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil; place potatoes in
skillet with largest flat side down. Season tops with half
the salt. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook until well
browned, about 4 minutes. Turn potatoes over and repeat, to
salt and brown the other side, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat
to medium, and use a paper towel to soak up excess oil
between potatoes in the pan. Add butter, and as it melts,
baste tops of potatoes with melted butter. Once butter has
toasted to a light brown color, turn off the heat and strain
in the miso dashi broth. Roast potatoes, uncovered, in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Remove and turn
potatoes over. Add the 2/3 cup plain chicken broth, and
return to the oven to continue roasting at 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C) until potatoes can be pierced very easily
with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes more. Check occasionally to
see if broth has evaporated; add more as needed. Brush tops
of potatoes with pan drippings, and serve.

Candied Jalapeños


Ingredients
1 pound jalapeÃ±o peppers
1 Â¾ cups brown sugar
Â¾ cup apple cider vinegar
Â½ teaspoon garlic powder
Â½ teaspoon celery seed
Â½ teaspoon ground turmeric
Â¼ teaspoon cumin seed
Â¼ teaspoon anise seed
Â¼ teaspoon salt
Â¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 pint-size canning jar

Cooking Instructions

While wearing gloves, rinse jalapeÃ±os and remove stem. Cut
into 1/4-inch slices and set aside. To reduce the heat from
the peppers, you may core out the centers with the seeds and
discard before slicing. Combine brown sugar and apple cider
vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic powder,
celery seed, turmeric, cumin seed, anise seed, salt, and red
pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer for 3 minutes. Add sliced
jalapeÃ±o peppers and simmer for an additional 4 to 5
minutes. Remove jalapeÃ±os to a jar using a slotted spoon.
Continue simmering liquid over medium-low heat until
slightly thickened, about 10 minutes more. Pour liquid over
the jalapeÃ±os and let cool. Use a strainer to remove excess
seeds from the liquid, if desired. Refrigerate for a minimum
of 3 days before eating. Store in the refrigerator for up to
3 months.

Easy Fermented Pickled Veggies


Ingredients
3 cups water
3 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 pound VEGETABLES)
1 bunch HERBS)
2 teaspoons peppercorns
3 cloves garlic,

Cooking Instructions

To sanitize jar, put a 1-quart wide-mouthed canning jar in a
6- to 8-quart pot; cover with tap water. (You could also use
multiple smaller wide-mouthed canning jars.) Bring to a
boil; boil 10 minutes. Using tongs, carefully remove jar
from pot, draining excess water; let jar cool slightly.
Meanwhile, for brine, stir together filtered water and salt
in a 1-quart measuring cup until salt is dissolved. Add
radishes (or other VEGETABLES), mint (or other HERBS),
peppercorns (or other KICK), and garlic to jar. Veggies can
be packed tightly; they will shrink and soften as they
pickle. Fill jar with brine; you may have brine left over.
Add a fermenting weight or an inverted, sanitized plastic
lid to keep vegetables submerged. Cover jar with a kitchen
towel, securing with a rubber band. Let stand at room
temperature for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days. Youâll
start to see bubbles forming. The vegetables will become
more tart and the brine will become cloudier the longer the
pickles stand. Remove fermenting weight and screw on metal
lid. Chill up to 3 weeks.

1/4 cup raw cashews
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 lemons
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil

time.) Remove from heat, rinse with cold water, drain, and
transfer on top of the pasta along with the green onions.
Add the dressing over the pasta and vegetables and toss
gently to combine. You may or may not use all of it

Million Dollar Potato Salad


Ingredients
4 large eggs
3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes
1/2 cup dill pickle brine, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
6 slices bacon
1/3 cup chives
1/4 cup dill pickles
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/3 cup crispy fried onions

Cooking Instructions

Gather your ingredients. Place eggs into a small pot and
cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then
remove from the heat and cover with a lid. Let sit for 10
minutes. Drain eggs and place into an ice bath to cool
completely. Peel eggs and cut into quarters, or smaller if
you prefer. Peel potatoes and cut into roughly 2-inch
chunks. Add potatoes to a large pot of cold water, season
the water generously with salt, and add 1/4 cup pickle juice
(this helps them to hold together once cooked - you can
alternatively use 2 tablespoons white vinegar). Bring to a
boil over a high heat, reduce the heat, and simmer until
potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes and
set aside. Meanwhile, make dressing: Stir Parmesan,
mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, and remaining 1/4 cup dill
pickle brine together in a bowl. Pour the dressing over the
hot potatoes and stir to coat. Taste and season with salt,
if needed, then leave to cool. Place bacon into a large
skillet and fry over medium heat, turning over to let both
sides crisp up, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove to a chopping board
and cut into bite-sized pieces. To the cooled potatoes, add
the boiled eggs, celery, chopped dill pickle, most of the
bacon and most of the chives. Mix together to combine. When
ready to serve, transfer the potato salad to a serving dish
and garnish with remaining chives and bacon, as well as the
crispy fried onions.

Ingredients
3 ounces Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon italian seasoning
2 teaspoons garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
2 pounds head cabbage

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230
degrees C) with racks in top third and lower third
positions. Line 2 large-rimmed baking sheets with parchment

between top and bottom racks and from front to back halfway
through. Remove cabbage from oven, and let stand undisturbed
for 2 minutes, before using a spatula to release cabbage
wedges from baking sheets. Turn cabbage wedges over, cheese
side up; and bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) until
cabbage is tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve hot.

Roasted Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce


Ingredients
1 pound asparagus,
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 large egg yolks
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon water
1/2 cup butter
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
1 large hard boiled egg, peeled
1 tablespoon chives (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Place asparagus on
the prepared pan and drizzle olive oil over the spears.
Season with salt and pepper. Using clean hands, toss
asparagus spears until evenly coated with olive oil and
seasonings, then spread asparagus in a single layer on the
pan. Roast in the center of the preheated oven until fork-
tender, 10 to 12 minutes; thicker asparagus may require more
time. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, and water
together in a heavy saucepan or small skillet with a wire
whisk until well blended. Season with salt and pepper. Turn
heat to medium-low; and whisk continuously, being careful to
stir the entire bottom and sides of the pan, until eggs
begin to thicken slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. If eggs start to
curdle, remove pan from heat, and continue whisking briskly
and continuously until any lumps disappear. Gradually whisk
in hot melted butter, about a tablespoon at a time, whisking
briskly after each addition. Adjust salt and pepper, if
necessary, and stir in cayenne pepper. When whisking, each
stroke of the whisk should reveal the bottom of the pan. If
the sauce is too thick, whisk in a drop or two of water or
lemon juice. To serve, plate asparagus and pour Hollandaise
sauce on top. Grate hard-boiled egg over Hollandaise, and
garnish with snipped chives.

1 cup milk
3 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/4 cups grits

1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
6 slices bacon
1 onion
4 green onions, divided
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
4 ounces okra, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cloves garlic
2 tomatoes
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, or to taste (optional)
2 cups peanut oil or other vegetable oil for frying
3 large eggs
1 1/2 pounds shrimp,
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 green onions, thinly sliced
chopped parsley for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine water, milk, butter, and salt in a large saucepan
and bring just to a boil. Whisk in grits until incorporated.
Reduce heat to simmer, cover, and cook until thick, 25 to 30
minutes, stirring often. If mixture gets too thick, add a
little more milk or water. Cut kernels off corn cobs, and
using the back of the knife, carefully scrape the cob to
release the creamy corn milk. Stir corn kernels and corn
milk into grits and continue cooking until grits are creamy
and tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer, stirring often. Stir in
pepper and adjust seasonings if necessary. Meanwhile, heat a
large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add olive
oil and bacon slices in a single layer, and cook until bacon
is crisp, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Remove
bacon from the skillet, drain on paper towels, and set
aside. Crumble bacon once cool enough to handle. Reserve
drippings in the skillet and return skillet to medium-high
heat. Finely slice green onions and reserve green ends for
garnish. Add white parts of green onion, onion, green and
red bell peppers, and okra to the skillet and cook until
softened and lightly browned, stirring often, about 5
minutes. Add in salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne and
cook for 1 minute. Add fresh tomatoes and garlic, and cook
for 2 minutes. Add butter to mixture and allow it to melt.
Sprinkle flour over skillet and cook, stirring constantly,
about 1 minute. Add in tomatoes, with juices, and stock
while stirring constantly until smooth. Stir in sugar,
Worcestershire, and hot sauce, and return mixture to a
simmer. Cook gravy for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Heat peanut oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large,
deep skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs in a bowl;
add shrimp and stir to coat. In a shallow dish, whisk flour,
salt, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Working a
few at a time, remove shrimp from egg, allowing excess to
drip off, and lightly coat in flour mixture. Transfer shrimp
to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with
remaining shrimp. Working in batches, add shrimp to hot oil
and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned and
crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on a wire rack set over a paper
towel-lined baking sheet. To serve, place grits in the
bottom of a shallow bowl. Top with about 1/2 cup of gravy
and 6 to 8 shrimp. Top with crumbled bacon, and sprinkle
with green onions and parsley if desired.

to add more ingredients. Heat neutral oil over medium-high
heat in a small saucepan until hot, about 5 minutes. Pour
hot oil carefully over green onion mixture. It will bubble
up, so pour slowly. Once the bubbling stops, stir the
mixture and allow to cool slightly. Stir in soy sauce,
oyster sauce and vinegar. Transfer mixture to a jar or
container with a tight fitting lid and refrigerate until
ready to use.

alfredo sauce pasta


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Soak cashews in 1 1/2 cups water in a bowl until softened,
at least 20 minutes. Drain water; add almond milk. Blend
mixture in an electric blender or food processor until
smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup water, or as
needed, until sauce is slightly thinner than you want it for
the final product, as it thickens when heated. Add garlic,
nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; blend
until smooth. Pour mixture into a saucepan. Heat on medium-
low heat, stirring occasionally until heated through and
desired thickness is achieved, about 5 minutes. You can add
additional water or almond milk if sauce becomes too thick.

asparagus


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over
medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper
towel-lined plate. Crumble bacon when cool; set aside.
Reserve 1 tablespoon of bacon drippings. Melt butter with
drippings in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir
celery and onion in the saucepan until onion is translucent,
about 4 minutes. Whisk flour into the mixture and cook for 1
minute. Whisk in chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add
potato and chopped asparagus stalks, reserving the asparagus
tips for later. Season with salt and ground black pepper.
Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Pour the soup into a
blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold
down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and
carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get
the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in
batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately,
you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the
cooking pot. Cook and stir mushrooms and asparagus tips in
the same skillet used for bacon until mushrooms give up
their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and ground
black pepper, if needed. Stir mushrooms, asparagus tips, and
half-and-half cream to pureed soup. Cook until thoroughly
heated. Garnish soup with crumbled bacon.

Adjarian Khachapuri


Ingredients
1 Â¼ cups whole milk, heated to lukewarm (110Â° to 115Â°F)
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
Â¾ teaspoon sugar
3 cups flour, plus more for dusting
1 tablespoon sunflower oil, plus more for brushing
Â¾ teaspoon plus a pinch of kosher salt
2 Â¼ cups shredded whole-milk mozzarella cheese
Â½ cup whole-milk ricotta cheese
4 large egg yolks
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened

Cooking Instructions

Whisk together milk, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let
stand, covered with a kitchen towel, until mixture is foamy,
about 10 minutes. Sift flour into milk mixture. Add oil and
3/4 teaspoon salt; stir with a rubber spatula until mixture
is well combined and a shaggy dough forms. Transfer to a
work surface and shape into a ball; knead until smooth and
soft but slightly sticky, about 5 minutes. Shape dough into
a ball and lightly brush with oil; transfer to a large bowl
and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm (70
to 80 degrees F (21 to 26 degrees C)) place until doubled in
size, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir together mozzarella and
ricotta in a small bowl. Season with remaining pinch of
salt; stir to combine. Divide dough into 4 equal portions.
Roll each into a 5x8-inch oval, about 1/4 inch thick, on a
lightly floured work surface. Spread about 1/4 cup cheese
mixture over each oval, leaving a 11/2-inch border
uncovered. Fold the long edges of each oval inward to meet
at the center and pinch the seam together tightly to seal in
cheese mixture. Turn dough over, so the seam side is down.
Use a small, sharp knife to make a shallow lengthwise slit
down the center of the top layer of dough, stopping within 1
inch of each end. Use your fingers to roll each long edge
away from the slit and tuck it under to create a rolled
border, sealing in some of the cheese mixture. Evenly divide
and spread remaining cheese mixture (about 1/4 cup each) in
the centers of each flatbread, lightly pressing into dough.
Arrange flatbreads 2 to 3 inches apart on 2 parchment-lined
baking sheets. Cover with a kitchen towel in a warm place
(70Â° to 80Â°F) until slightly puffed, 25 to 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake,
rotating baking sheets halfway through, until edges are
golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Use a spoon to make a well
in the center of the filling in each flatbread. Put an egg
yolk in each well. Bake until yolks are thickened but still
runny, 30 to 40 seconds more. Transfer flatbreads to a
serving platter. Top each with 1/2 tablespoon butter. Stir
yolks into melted cheese. Serve hot.

1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon melted butter
2 tablespoons green onions (optional)
2 tablespoons green chilies (optional)
4 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into very small cubes
1 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese
3 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter, divided
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon hot chili pepper flakes
1 tablespoon green onions (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place
potatoes in a baking dish, and pierce skins several times
with a knife. Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until very
tender when tested with a knife, about 1 hour. Remove from
the oven, cover with a towel, and cool potatoes to room
temperature, about 30 minutes. Turn oven off. Place flour in
a bowl, and make a small well in the center with a fork.
Pour milk, water, and salt into the well, and stir with a
fork to form a shaggy dough. Pour in the 1 tablespoon melted
butter, and continue to mix with a fork until dough begins
to come together. Lightly flour your hand and knead in the
bowl until the sides of the bowl are clean, and dough forms
into a ball. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work
surface and knead until dough is smooth and slightly
elastic, 2 to 4 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and set
aside to rest for 15 to 30 minutes. Measure out 8 ounces of
cooled, cooked potato; add to a bowl and mash with the back
of a fork, until slightly chunky or completely smooth, as
desired. Add green onions, green chilies, mozzarella,
Cheddar, and feta cheese and stir thoroughly to combine.
Season with salt and pepper. Mash filling into a compact
disc, about 5 inches in diameter, in the bottom of the bowl.
Turn filling out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap tightly,
give filling a final shaping, and place in the refrigerator
until ready to use. Roll dough out on a well-floured work
surface into a 10- to 11-inch circle. Place chilled filling
disc in center of dough circle. Working around the circle,
fold dough up toward the center to cover filling completely,
pleating dough as needed and using a moistened finger to
stick dough together where it overlaps. Flour the top, and
flip over so the seam side is down. Again, flour the top of
filled dough, and roll gently into an even circle, 3/4- to
1-inch thick. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick
skillet over medium heat. Gently place filled bread in the
skillet and cook, covered, until the bottom is a light
golden brown, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip over, and
cook, covered, until the other side is golden, about 5
minutes. Turn bread back over, and brush top and sides with
remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter. Cook for 1 to 2
minutes more. If flatbread begins to bulge, poke a small
hole with a knife to release steam. Transfer to a cutting
board and cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stir honey
and pepper flakes together in a small bowl. Sprinkle
flatbread with green onions, cut into wedges, and serve with
spicy honey.

Cinnamon Roll Focaccia


Ingredients
1/4 cup canola oil,
all-purpose flour
2 (1-pound) pizza dough
1/4 cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
7 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 ounces cream cheese
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon whole milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Evenly coat a 13- x 9-inch baking
pan with 1/4 cup of the oil. On a lightly floured work
surface, using your hands or a rolling pin, press dough
balls into about 1-inch thickness. Stir together 2
tablespoons light brown sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a

sugar mixture, place second dough round on top, and knead
together until combined and one ball of dough is formed.
Place dough in the prepared pan, cover with plastic wrap,
and let rest in a warm place for 3 hours, removing plastic
every hour and gently pressing out dough as thin as
possible. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Uncover dough, and spread into an even layer pressing into
the edges of the pan. Grease your hands and make deep
dimples all over the top of the dough with your fingertips.
Drizzle evenly with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and make
dimples all over top of the dough with your fingertips
again. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly risen and
starting to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt 6
tablespoons of the butter in a small saucepan over medium.
Remove from heat, add remaining 1/4 cup light brown sugar
and remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and stir until combined;
drizzle evenly over dough. Return to oven and bake at 450
degrees F (230 degrees C) until well browned and puffed, 8
to 10 more minutes. Meanwhile, combine cream cheese and
remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a bowl and beat on medium
speed with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, about
30 seconds. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating at low
speed until blended, about 30 seconds. Stir in milk and
vanilla until icing is smooth and creamy. Drizzle icing over
hot bread; serve warm.

Green Onion Garlic Naan Bread


Ingredients
1 Â½ cups bread flour, plus more as needed
Â½ teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup plain Greek yogurt
4 cloves garlic, crushed
Â½ cup thinly sliced green onions
2 tablespoons melted butter

Cooking Instructions

Place bread flour in a bowl. Add salt and baking powder and
give it a good whisk until evenly combined. Add in Greek
yogurt gently, followed by garlic and green onions. Take a
wooden spoon and slowly start mixing everything together.
Keep mixing, stirring, and pressing until a shaggy dough
forms. Transfer dough to a work surface and use your hands
to press dough together. Knead for a few minutes until dough
becomes elastic and a little bit sticky. Add a bit more
flour as necessary but try to keep extra flour at an
absolute minimum. Knead until dough is a little bit
stretchy, 3 to 5 minutes. Wrap in plastic and allow to rest
on the counter for 15 to 20 minutes. Take a bench scraper
and cut into 6 equal pieces. Take 1 portion and roll into a
ball. Place onto a generously floured surface. Use a rolling
pin to roll out nice and thin, about 1/8 inch or less. It's
ok if the naan is not a perfect circle. You will need extra
flour for rolling out as the dough is sticky, but try to use
as little as possible. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-
high heat until hot. Transfer dough circles into the hot dry
skillet and cook until little bubbles form on the surface
and the underside is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Flip
naan over and cook for 1 more minute. Press down slightly
with a spatula to increase the heat during cooking. Flip
over twice more and cook for an additional 15 seconds per
side, but make sure not to overcook to preserve the texture.
Naan should still be flexible when you remove it from the
skillet onto a plate. Cover with a kitchen towel to keep
warm and moist while you cook the other naan breads. Stack
all 6 naan breads on top of each other and keep covered with
a kitchen towel. When you are finished cooking all 6 naan
breads, unstack breads and brush the first naan bread on
both sides with a little bit of melted butter. Stack second
piece of naan on top and only brush the top side. Keep
stacking and buttering all the naan breads. Fold each naan
into a triangle and serve.

â cup sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
Â½ teaspoon salt
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
â cup butter, melted
â cup brown sugar
1 Â½ teaspoons cinnamon
4 tablespoons butter, softened
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 tablespoon milk
Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups powdered sugar

Cooking Instructions

Mix together milk and water in a glass measuring cup for the
dough. Microwave mixture until it reaches 105 degrees F to
115 degrees F (40 degrees C to 46 degrees C), 30 to 60
seconds. Whisk together flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a
large bowl. Add eggs, melted butter, and milk mixture. Beat

Iced Dried Cherry Biscuits


Ingredients
2 1/4 cups flour, plus more for rolling
3/4 cup dried cherries
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons orange zest, plus more for garnish
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon sea salt
stick (8 tablespoons) butter
3/4 cup Greek-style yogurt
1/2 cup orange juice, or more as needed
1 cup sifted powdered sugar
5 teaspoons whole milk
1/8 teaspoon sea salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C). Line a
large baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together
flour, dried cherries, sugar, baking powder, orange zest,
baking soda, and fine sea salt in a large bowl. Coat whole
stick of butter in the flour mixture. Grate butter on the
large holes of a box grater into bowl. If butter starts to
melt, coat butter in flour mixture again and continue
grating. Use your fingers to toss butter in flour mixture
until all butter pieces are separated and coated in flour.
Mixture should resemble coarse crumbs. Whisk together yogurt
and orange juice in a small bowl; add to flour mixture.
Gently fold to bring dough together. Dough should be
moistened but still crumbly. If dough is too dry, add more
cold orange juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, until fully
moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work
surface. Lightly knead three or four times until dough comes
together. Sprinkle with flour; pat to 3/4 inch thickness.
Cut dough into four equal portions. Stack portions, press
down, and pat again to form a 3/4-inch-thick rectangle.
Repeat process three times, adding flour as needed. Press a
2 1/2- to 3-inch biscuit cutter straight down into dough to
cut out biscuits. Gently knead scraps together, pat to
3/4-inch thickness, and repeat cutting. Arrange on prepared
baking sheet (biscuits should be barely touching). Bake
until tops are crisp and golden brown, 15 to 16 minutes. Let
cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Stir together
powdered sugar, milk, and 1/8 teaspoon sea salt in a bowl
until icing is well combined. Drizzle biscuits with icing;
garnish with more orange zest. Store in an airtight
container up to 3 days; chill up to 1 week. To reheat, bake
about 10 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Â¾ cup warm whole milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 large egg, room temperature
1 large egg yolk, room temperature
Â½ cup unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons honey
1 Â½ teaspoons freshly grated orange zest
Â¼ cup freshly squeezed orange juice
3 Â½ cups all-purpose flour, divided, or more as needed
1 Â½ teaspoons kosher salt
cooking spray
Â½ cup unsalted butter, softened
Â½ cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 Â½ teaspoons freshly grated orange zest
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon freshly grated orange zest
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed orange juice
Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Pour warmed milk into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with
a paddle attachment for the dough. Sprinkle yeast evenly
over the surface of the milk. Let stand until foamy, 5 to 10
minutes. Add egg and egg yolk, butter, honey, orange zest,
and orange juice to the yeast mixture. Beat on low until
combined, about 45 seconds. Add 2 cups flour; beat on low
until a wet dough forms, about 1 minute. Turn off mixer;
switch to the dough hook attachment. Add 1 Â½ cups flour and
salt, beat on medium until dough is soft and elastic, 7 to
10 minutes. If necessary, add an additional Â½ cup flour,
tablespoon by tablespoon, using as little as possible to
achieve a soft dough. The dough should be quite sticky.
Gather dough into a ball and transfer to a large greased
bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise at room
temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. To make the
filling: Combine butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and orange
zest in a bowl. Mix with a spatula until smooth and creamy,
about 1 minute. Set aside. Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish;
set aside. Punch down the dough and transfer to a well-
floured surface. Roll dough into a large 10x18-inch
rectangle. Spread the filling over the surface of the dough,
leaving a Â½ inch border along the top long edge. Roll the
dough away from you to create a log, and pinch seam to seal.
Cut dough log into 12 equal rolls (about 1 Â½ inches wide).
Transfer rolls to prepared baking dish. Loosely cover with
plastic wrap, and set aside to rise at room temperature
until puffy and almost doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake
rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 22 to 25
minutes. While rolls are baking, prepare the frosting.
Combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, orange zest, orange
zest, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the
paddle attachment. Beat at medium-high speed until very
smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove rolls from oven
and transfer to a wire rack. Let cool 2 minutes, then spread
frosting evenly over the rolls. Serve warm.

Pepper Jack Cornbread Biscuits


Ingredients
2 cups self-rising flour (see Tip)
1 cup yellow cornmeal
2 tablespoons white sugar
Â½ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 stick (1/2 cup) very cold unsalted butter, cubed
1 Â¼ cups cold buttermilk
2 ounces pepper Jack cheese
2 tablespoons melted butter for brushing tops

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Mix together self-rising flour,
cornmeal, white sugar, salt, and baking soda (See Cook's
Note for substitution). Add cubed, very cold butter and mix
in with a pastry cutter/blender until the mixture is crumbly
and the butter pieces are approximately the size of lentils.
Stir in the buttermilk with a fork until a crumbly dough
forms, which can be pressed together with your hands. Press
into a square, and roll out into a 12 x12-inch square. Cut
in half, and stack one piece on the other. Roll back out to
a 12-inch square. Jagged edges are fine, and can simply be
pressed in with a bench scraper. Cut into quarters, and
stack up. Square up the sides a little by pressing in with a
bench scraper, and roll back out to a 12-inch square.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with a Silpat mat. Grate the pepper Jack cheese
over the top of the dough (for best results, pop cheese in
the freezer for a few minutes to firm up, making it easier
to grate and distribute evenly). Fold into thirds to form a
rectangle, and press lightly. Roll until the rectangle is
about 3/4 inch thick, and then use a floured round cutter
(mine was 2.75 inches) to punch out 8 biscuits. Dough can
also be cut into squares instead. Transfer cut dough to the
prepared baking sheet. Extra dough can be pressed together
and re-rolled, and used to cut more biscuits. Press each
biscuit lightly in the center with your thumb. Brush each
biscuit lightly with melted butter. Bake in the preheated
oven until nicely risen and golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
While still warm, brush with more melted butter if desired.
Let cool before serving. Enjoy!

Perfect Pan Pizza


Ingredients
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 cup water
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
6 ounces part skim mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup pizza sauce (see below)
1/3 cup pepperoni

Cooking Instructions

Whisk flour, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir
water and 1 tablespoon olive oil together in a separate bowl
or measuring cup and add to flour mixture. Stir just until
well combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let stand at
room temperature until dough has tripled in size, 8 to 12
hours. Alternatively, cover and refrigerate at least 12
hours and up to 36 hours, or until dough has tripled in
size. Uncover dough and transfer to a floured surface.
Gently stretch and fold dough over a few times until nearly
smooth; use your hands to lightly shape dough into a ball.
Dough should remain a little sticky. Pour remaining olive
oil into a 12-inch cast iron skillet and use your fingers to
liberally coat the bottom and sides of the skillet. Using
oiled hands, transfer dough to the skillet, gently flatten
into a thick disc shape, and lightly coat with some of the
oil. Lightly cover the skillet with plastic wrap and set
aside at room temperature for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to
400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Use fingers to lightly press
dough to an even layer to the edges of the pan and about 1/2
inch up the sides. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese around the edges
and over dough. Sprinkle 1/3 cup shredded mozzarella over
dough. Spread pizza sauce in an even layer over entire
crust. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top with
pepperoni. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden
around the edges and cheese is lightly browned and melted,
20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on the
stove over medium heat. Cook until bottom of crust is golden
brown and toasted, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully slide pizza
from the pan to a wire rack; let stand for 10 minutes.
Transfer pizza to a cutting board; slice and serve.

1 Â¼ cups warm water
1 Â½ tablespoons
1 (1/4-ounce) envelope active dry yeast
3 Â½ cups
1 teaspoon
neutral cooking oil,
cooking spray
tablespoon
2 tablespoons hot water
2 cups part-skim mozzarella cheese
30 pepperoni slices
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
pretzel salt
1/3 cup whole milk
8 ounces processed cheese
1 tablespoon
Â½ teaspoon onion powder
Â½ teaspoon paprika
Â½ teaspoon
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Prepare the pizza: Place warm water,
sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a
dough hook. Whisk until just combined, and let stand until
foamy, about 5 minutes. Add flour and salt; mix on low speed
until just combined, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to
medium, and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5
minutes. Shape dough into a ball, and transfer to a large
greased bowl, rotating dough to coat all sides in oil. Cover
with plastic wrap or a clean damp towel; let rest in a warm
area until doubled in size, 25 to 30 minutes. Preheat the
oven to 425 degrees F (230 degrees C) with a pizza stone or
overturned large rimmed baking sheet on the center rack.
Grease a large 15-inch pizza pan with cooking spray. Punch
down dough, and transfer to the prepared pizza pan. Using
clean hands, press dough to the outer edge of the pan (dough
should be 15 inches in diameter). Fold 1 to 1 1/2-inches of
doughâs outer edge over itself to create adefined crust
(dough should be 13 inches in diameter to the outer edge).
Combine baking soda and hot water in a small bowl. Using a
pastry brush, brush the top and outer edges of crust;
discard any remaining baking soda mixture. Bake crust on
pizza stone in preheated oven until crust is golden brown,
about 8 minutes. Meanwhile prepare the cheese sauce: Bring
milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium. Reduce
heat to low; add processed cheese, in batches, whisking
constantly until melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk in butter,
onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, and salt until smooth.
Set aside until ready to use. Spread cheese sauce evenly
over par-baked crust. Sprinkle with an even layer of
mozzarella cheese, and top evenly with pepperoni slices.
Brush outer crust with melted butter, and sprinkle evenly
with pretzel salt. Bake in the preheated oven at 425 degrees
F (230 degrees C) until mozzarella is slightly browned and
melted and crust is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove
from oven, and let cool on pizza pan for 5 minutes. Slice
and serve.

Reuben Crescent Rolls


Ingredients
2 (8-count) cans crescent rolls
8 thin slices pastrami or corned beef
4 slices Swiss cheese
1 cup sauerkraut
8 teaspoons thousand island salad dressing
1 large egg, beaten
2 teaspoons caraway seeds

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and line a
sheet pan with parchment paper. On a cutting board or work
surface, separate crescent rolls into 16 triangles, lining
them up so that the thin points of the triangles point away
from you. Cut each slice of pastrami or corned beef
diagonally, into 2 triangles, making 16. Cut each Swiss
cheese slice in half, then cut each half diagonally, to make
16 triangles. For each triangle of crescent dough, place a
triangle of meat and shape it to be slightly smaller than
the crescent dough. Add a triangle of Swiss cheese. Place 1
tablespoon sauerkraut along the bottom edge of each
triangle. Add 1/2 teaspoon Thousand Island salad dressing on
top of the sauerkraut. Roll the crescents away from you,
beginning at the wide end and rolling to the narrow point,
the same way a crescent roll is made, keeping the filling
ingredients inside the dough as it rolls. Place each
completed roll on the prepared pan. Brush each roll-up with
egg, and sprinkle with caraway seeds. Bake in the preheated
oven until golden brown and hot throughout, 21 to 25
minutes. Remove to cool on a baking rack for 3 to 5 minutes.

2 1/4 cups all purpose flour, plus more as needed
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
8 ounces ground pork breakfast sausage (or sausage links with casings removed)
1 1/2 teaspoons all purpose flour
4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
4 green onions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish
2 tablespoons milk
2 sage leaves, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne
1 large egg, beaten, divided

Cooking Instructions

Combine warm milk, yeast, sugar, salt, and melted butter in
the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attached. Add
egg and flour. Drop down dough hook and start kneading on
low speed, stopping and scraping down the sides every so
often in the beginning to make sure all the ingredients are
incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Once everything has come
together, increase speed 1 notch and continue kneading until
dough is very soft, very smooth, and slightly elastic, about
2 minutes. Transfer dough onto a work surface, knead for 1
minute, and shape into a smooth ball. Since the dough has
butter in it, it wonât be sticky. Return dough ball to a
lightly buttered bowl. Cover, and allow to rise in a warm
spot until it has doubled in size, about 90 minutes. Once
dough is risen, transfer to a work surface and punch down to
de-gas. Shape back into a ball, and weigh on a digital
scale. Divide amount by 8 and weigh out 8 equal dough
portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball, using just
enough flour to keep it from sticking. Press and flatten the
dough into a disc about 3 1/2-inches wide and a 1/2-inch
thick. Shape with your hands to make a small indention in
the middle. Transfer to a silpat-lined baking sheet. Cover
and let proof until almost doubles in size, 45 to 60
minutes. Combine cooled sausage, cream cheese, green onions,
milk, sage, Â½ of the beaten egg, salt, pepper, and cayenne
in a bowl. Mix filling into a thick paste with a spoon.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) Use
slightly damp fingertips to press a well into the center of
each kolache to place the filling. Be sure to leave no more
that 3/4-inch of un-pressed dough around the outside. Do not
press all the way through the dough to the baking sheet.
Brush each kolache with remaining egg wash. Fill evenly with
the sausage cream cheese mixture. Bake in the preheated oven
until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven,
transfer to a wire rack, and allow to rest for 10 to 15
minutes before serving. Top with sliced green onions for
garnish.

Semla (Swedish Fat Tuesday Buns)


Ingredients
1 cup warm milk (95-100 degrees F)
1 package active dry yeast (2 teaspoons)
1 â cups all-purpose flour
2 cups all-purpose flour
7 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
â cup powdered sugar
1 large egg
2 Â½ teaspoons ground cardamom
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg
1 teaspoon water
14 ounces almond paste
Â½ cup powdered sugar
â cup milk, or as needed to achieve desired texture
1 teaspoon ground cardamom, or to taste
1 Â½ cups heavy cream, whipped
2 tablespoons powdered sugar for dusting

Cooking Instructions

Pour milk into the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle yeast on
top, followed by 1 1/3 cups flour and mix with a wooden
spoon. Allow to stand until foamy, about 20 minutes. Add
flour, softened butter, powdered sugar, egg, cardamom, and
salt; knead with dough hook (or by hand) until a soft,
smooth, elastic dough forms, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer dough
to a lightly floured surface and shape into a ball. Divide
into 12 equal portions. Using flour as necessary, roll dough
under a cupped hand to form perfectly smooth balls. Place
dough balls evenly on a parchment lined baking sheet,
leaving space in between and slightly push down. Dust tops
with flour, and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let rise
in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Preheat
the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Stir together egg
and water in a small bowl and brush rolls all over with egg
wash. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about
12 minutes. Transfer buns onto a wire rack and let cool
completely. Combine almond paste, powdered sugar, milk, and
cardamom in a food processor and blend almond filling until
smooth. Cut a triangle from the top of the buns, and remove
some of the crumbs to make room for the filling. Pipe almond
filling into each bun, and top with whipped cream. Place the
triangle on top and dust with powdered sugar before serving.

Sour Cream Donuts


Ingredients
2 Â¼ cups bleached cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
Â¾ teaspoon kosher salt
Â½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
Â¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
â cup sour cream, room temperature
Â½ cup granulated sugar
2 large egg yolks, room temperature
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
vegetable oil as needed for frying
4 Â½ cups powdered sugar
Â½ cup unsalted butter, melted
6 tablespoons hot water
1 Â½ teaspoons light corn syrup
Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt
Â¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon
together in a bowl until well combined. Whisk sour cream,
granulated sugar, egg yolks, melted butter, oil, and vanilla
together in a large bowl until well combined. Gradually fold
flour mixture into sour cream mixture just until combined.
(Dough will be quite soft and sticky.) Cover, and chill in
the refrigerator until dough is cold and just slightly
firmed, about 2 hours. Turn dough out onto a heavily-floured
surface and pat or roll to 3/8- to 1/2-inch thickness,
flouring hands or rolling pin as needed. Cut dough using a
floured 3 Â½-inch round cutter. Cut holes in the center of
the dough circles using a floured 1 Â¼-inch round cutter.
Transfer dough rings to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Reroll, and cut dough scraps, repeating process as needed.
Heat 3 inches of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat
until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F to 365
degrees F (182 degrees C to 185 degrees C). Fry 1 to 2
donuts at a time until golden brown and cooked through,
about 1 to 1 Â½ minutes per side, adjusting heat as necessary
to maintain oil temperature. Transfer donuts to a baking
sheet lined with paper towels using a spider strainer. Let
drain, and cool for 5 minutes (see note). Whisk together
powdered sugar, melted butter, hot water, corn syrup, salt,
and vanilla in a large bowl for the glaze until smooth and
well combined. Place 1 warm donut in the powdered sugar
mixture, craggy side up; use a spoon to coat donut
completely in the glaze. Remove donut from glaze using two
forks placed underneath; let excess drip off, and then
transfer donut to a wire rack placed over a rimmed baking
sheet. Repeat with remaining donuts and glaze. Let donuts
stand until glaze is set before serving, about 25 minutes.

Thousand Layer Chocolate Brioche


Ingredients
Â¾ cup warm whole milk
1 package active dry yeast
4 Â½ cups all-purpose flour
3 large eggs, beaten
â cup white granulated sugar
1 teaspoon fine salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, very soft
4 tablespoons unsalted butter for laminating dough
Â½ cup dark chocolate chunks
1 large whole egg for brushing
coarse sea salt
white granulated sugar

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Combine warm milk and dry active
yeast in the bowl of your stand mixer; let stand for 10
minutes. Add flour, eggs, sugar, and salt. Use the dough
hook to knead the mixture until the flour almost disappears,
about 1 minute. Add the soft room temperature butter, and
continue kneading the dough until a very smooth ball of
dough forms, 4 to 5 minutes. Set dough into a lightly
buttered bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until
doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours. Punch down the dough and
divide in 2 pieces. Form each half into a smooth ball and
transfer each one into a plastic bag. Refrigerate bags
overnight for best results or the dough can be used
immediately. Each half of the dough will make 4 brioche.
When ready to make, roll and stretch dough into a 14 x 10
inch rectangle. Spread 4 tablespoons of soft room
temperature butter over two thirds of the dough, stopping
1/2 inch from the edge. Fold unbuttered third up over the
top, and then the opposite end to complete the trifold.
Gently press and seal the edges together. Fold in thirds
again to form a square. Wrap and place in the freezer until
cold and slightly firm, about 15 minutes. Roll the dough out
into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick, or thin enough to
fold, and repeat the two folding in thirds step. Wrap and
place in the freezer again until cold and slightly firm, 15
more minutes. A little bit of water can be used to help the
dough stick if needed. Roll dough out into a rectangle
again, just like in the previous step. Fold into thirds, but
keep as a rectangle (do not make the second fold). Wrap and
place in the freezer until cold and slightly firm, about 15
minutes. Roll dough into a 12 x 6 inch rectangle and place
in the freezer until cold and slightly firm, about 15
minutes. Trim off about 1/8 inch of dough from the sides and
cut into 4 rectangles that are about 6 x 3 inches. Start
with 1 piece (keeping the others in the fridge so they stay
cool) and make two cuts starting 1/2 inch from top, all the
way to the bottom to create 3 strips of dough. Braid
together, and seal at bottom. Flip over and add about 1
tablespoon of dark chocolate chunks along the center of the
braided dough, or more to taste. Roll up from the smaller
end to create a knot. Place seam side down in buttered
muffin tin. After all braids are done, cover, and let rise
in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat
the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush brioche
with egg wash, and sprinkle very lightly with some coarse
salt. Then sprinkle very generously with the granulated
sugar. Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until
nicely browned, 20 to 25 minutes. If brioches are getting
too dark, tent with aluminum foil after 15 minutes. Let cool
in the pan for about 5 minutes and then transfer onto a rack
to cool completely before serving. Serve and enjoy!

Triple Coffee Sweet Rolls


Ingredients
1/4 cup espresso powder
2 cups milk,
2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon espresso powder
1 tablespoon cocoa
1 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar
3 tablespoons espresso or strong coffee, or more as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine 1/4 cup instant espresso and hot milk in the bowl of
a stand mixer, and let cool until just warm to the touch,
about 95 degrees F (35 degrees C). Add yeast, egg, white
sugar, salt, and 6 tablespoons melted butter. Add most of
the flour, attach the dough hook, and knead on low speed
until everything comes together and begins to pull away from
the sides of the bowl. Turn mixer speed up a notch, and
continue to knead until a smooth, soft, elastic dough forms,
adding in remaining flour as needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove
dough from the mixer, form into a ball, and place back in
the bowl. Cover and let it rise in a warm place until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, make filling. Melt
1/2 cup butter in a small pan over medium heat. Stir in
brown sugar, cocoa, and 1 tablespoon instant espresso
powder. Once combined, remove from heat and let cool. As
soon as butter starts to cool and solidify, stir to form a
thick, spreadable paste. Reserve until needed. Once dough
has risen, use your hands to press out the air, and reshape
into a ball. For best results, transfer dough to a plastic
bag and place in the refrigerator overnight. Dough can be
used right away if need be. Very lightly flour a work
surface. Turn dough out onto the work surface, press into a
rectangle, and very lightly dust the top with flour. Roll
out into a 12x18-inch rectangle. Spread filling evenly to
the edges, leaving a few inches along one of the long sides
free of filling. Lightly brush exposed dough with water;
this will help to seal the seam. Beginning with the long
side that has filling, roll dough and filling toward the
long side with exposed dough to form a uniform log,
finishing with the seam on the bottom. Generously butter a
9x12- or 13-inch baking dish or pan, and, if desired, line
the bottom with buttered parchment. Score the log of dough
into 12 equal portions, and then cut each portion with a
piece of string as shown. Place cut rolls into the prepared
pan. Cover rolls and leave to rise in a warm spot until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375
degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until
puffed, golden brown at the edges, and an instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center, reads 200 degrees F
(95 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes
before icing. Whisk together confectionerâs sugar with 3 to
4 tablespoons of espresso or strong coffee, or enough to
form an icing that can be drizzled over with a spoon.
Drizzle icing over rolls and let cool before serving, or
enjoy slightly warm.

cheddar biscuits


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Combine mozzarella cheese and cream cheese in a large
microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave on high power
until slightly melted, about 45 seconds. Remove from
microwave and stir. Repeat, heating for about 20 seconds
more. Remove from microwave again and stir; consistency
should be very sticky and cheese should be completely
melted. Return to microwave, if necessary, until all cheese
is melted. Mix almond flour, eggs, baking powder, and garlic
powder together in a bowl. Add mixture to the large bowl
with melted cheese and mix well. Add Cheddar cheese and stir
into the dough. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on a flat
surface and dust lightly with almond flour. Pour dough onto
the middle of the plastic wrap and roll up to form a ball.
Place in the refrigerator until slightly hardened, 20 to 30
minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Grease a dark baking sheet with butter. Remove dough from
the refrigerator and cut into 8 equal-sized pieces. Roll
each into a ball and place on the prepared baking sheet,
spacing equally and avoiding the sides, as biscuits will
spread while cooking. Bake in the preheated oven until
golden brown, checking at 10 minutes. Remove from oven
immediately and cool completely before serving, about 15
minutes.

Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwich


Ingredients
2 slices bacon
4 teaspoons butter, divided
3 large eggs
1 pinch black pepper
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
4 slices bread

Cooking Instructions

Place bacon in a nonstick skillet and cook over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 7
minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Remove bacon to
a drip line tray. Drain off bacon grease for another use.
Wash out the skillet. Whisk eggs with salt and pepper in a
small bowl until frothy. Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the
nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs; let
cook for 30 seconds. Lift the edges of the omelet so that
the uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges and comes into
contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to
move the uncooked egg. Repeat until the top is set, about 3
minutes; reduce heat to low. Meanwhile, chop bacon roughly;
sprinkle over omelet. Sprinkle with cheese; allow cheese to
melt, 1 to 2 minutes. Meanwhile, butter 2 slices of bread
with 1/2 teaspoon butter each. Lay bread, buttered side up,
side-by-side over omelet, leaving about 1 inch between
slices. The melted cheese will help the bread adhere. Run a
spatula around the entire omelet to loosen from the skillet.
Carefully turn the omelet over so buttered side of bread is
in contact with the skillet. Cook until bread is toasted and
golden, about 2 minutes. Using the spatula, fold in edges of
omelet to align with sides of the bread. Cut omelet along
center with the spatula to form 2 sandwiches. Butter 2
remaining bread slices with remaining butter; place butter
side up on each sandwich. Turn sandwiches; cook until
golden, about 2 minutes more. Serve and enjoy immediately!

Chef Johns Tortilla de Patatas


Ingredients
2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or russet potatoes, peeled
1 yellow onion
5 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 cup olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Slice potatoes and onions with a very sharp knife or
mandoline into 1/8-inch thick slices. Combine eggs, 1/2
teaspoon salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl and
whisk very thoroughly; set aside. Add 1/3 cup olive oil to a
large nonstick pan and set heat to medium-high. Add
potatoes, onions, and remaining salt. Cook, tossing and
stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, and some
onions and potatoes are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
Between stirrings, cover potatoes to reduce cooking time and
keep in moisture. For less browning, reduce heat to medium.
Stir potato mixture into egg mixture with a spatula. Cover
and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Add remaining olive oil
to an 8- or 9-inch nonstick pan, and set the pan over
medium-high heat. Pour in egg and potato mixture, and smooth
the top. Cook, covered, for about 4 minutes or until the
bottom is browned and the edges of tortilla begin to firm
up. Slide tortilla out onto a plate, cover with another
plate, and flip the plates over to invert. Slide tortilla
back into the pan, and place back over medium-high heat.
Cook, uncovered, until the tortilla is fully set, about 2
minutes more. Tortilla will spring back lightly when pressed
in the middle with a finger if eggs are fully cooked. If it
feels soft or mushy when pressed, cook for a few minutes
more, unless you prefer the tortilla less than fully set.
Slip tortilla onto a serving plate, and serve hot, warm, or
room temperature.

Chilaquiles with Homemade Tomato Sauce


Ingredients
16 corn tortillas
2 cups oil, or as needed for frying
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
2 cups water
2 chiles, stems and seeds removed
1 white onion, quartered
3 cloves garlic
4 tomatoes, quartered
2 jalapenos, halved
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 (14.5 ounce) fire-roasted diced tomatoes
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 large eggs
1/2 cup queso fresco
1 avocado, sliced
1/4 cup crema
sliced radish, hot sauce, chopped cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Cut each tortilla into 8 wedges. Heat oil to 350 degrees F
(180 degrees C) in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add
tortillas to fry in batches, taking care not to crowd the
pot. Cook, stirring constantly until golden and crispy, 1 to
2 minutes. Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and drain
well on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt to taste
immediately. Repeat with remaining tortillas. In a large
saucepan, add water and guajillo chiles. Bring mixture to a
boil over high heat, reduce temperature, and simmer until
chiles soften, about 5 minutes. Return heat to medium-high
and add onion, garlic, tomatoes, jalapenos, cumin, and 1
teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion has
softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully
pour mixture into a blender or food processor. Add canned
tomatoes, vinegar, and olive oil. Remove center from the lid
to allow steam to escape and blend until smooth, about 1
minute, scraping down the sides as necessary. In a large
skillet over medium heat, add 1 cup of sauce and bring to a
simmer, stirring often. Add 1/4 of the chips and cook about
3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the chips are well-
coated in sauce and fully heated through. Place chips on a
plate. In a separate small skillet, heat 1/2 tablespoon
butter over medium heat. Crack an egg into the butter and
cook over easy or as desired. Add egg to chips and top with
queso fresco, avocado, crema, and any other desired
toppings.

Crescent Breakfast Squares


Ingredients
2 12x16-inch parchment paper sheets
2 (12 ounce) packages crescent roll dough (such as PillsburyÂ® Grands!â¢)
8 slices deli ham
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or more to taste
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
Â½ cup diced onion
Â½ cup diced red bell pepper
10 large eggs
1 tablespoon half-and-half cream or heavy whipping cream
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
8 slices Swiss cheese
1 tablespoon bagel seasoning (such as Trader Joe'sÂ® Everything But the Bagel Seasoning Blend)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread each
sheet of parchment on a work surface. Unroll crescent dough,
and place the contents of one can on each sheet. Roll dough
into two 10x15-inch rectangles, making sure the perforations
are sealed, one rectangle per parchment. Slide one dough
rectangle with its parchment paper onto a 13x18-inch sheet
pan; reserve the second rectangle for later use. Working
with the first piece of dough, spread ham slices over the
dough, leaving about 1/2-inch on all sides. Spread Dijon
mustard in a thin layer over the ham slices. Melt 1
tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook
and stir onions and bell peppers until slightly softened,
about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low; add 1 tablespoon
butter to skillet with vegetables until melted. Whisk eggs,
half-and-half or cream, salt, and pepper together in a large
bowl until well blended. Pour egg mixture into the skillet
with vegetables. Cook, using a spatula to lift and move,
until eggs are just set and still wet looking. Spoon lightly
cooked egg mixture in an even layer over the ham slices,
maintaining the 1/2-inch dough border all around. Place
sliced Swiss cheese in a single layer over the eggs. Place
the second dough rectangle over all, using the parchment to
help you align it. Carefully peel off the parchment. Moisten
fingertips and press the edges of the two dough rectangles
together, then use a fork to crimp. Melt remaining 1
tablespoon butter; brush over the top of the dough with a
pastry brush. Sprinkle bagel seasoning over all. Bake in the
preheated oven until nicely browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove to cool on a wire rack for about 15 minutes. Slice
into serving pieces with a sharp knife.

Crêpes Suzette


Ingredients
Â½ cup whole milk
â cup water
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon white sugar
Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt
Â¾ cup all-purpose flour
Â¼ cup unsalted butter, melted, divided
1 teaspoon freshly grated orange zest
â cup fresh orange juice
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
Â¼ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 tablespoon orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier)
Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt
Â¼ cup orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier)
Â½ cup vanilla ice cream, or to taste

Cooking Instructions

To make the crÃªpes: Combine milk, water, eggs, sugar, and
salt in a blender; blend on medium speed until smooth, about
10 seconds. Add flour and blend until smooth, about 5 more
seconds. Add 2 tablespoons of the melted butter and orange
zest; pulse until incorporated, about 3 (1-second) pulses.
Cover blender and place in refrigerator; let rest for 15
minutes. Remove crÃªpe batter from fridge. Heat a 6-inch
nonstick skillet or crÃªpe pan over medium heat. Add 1/2
teaspoon of the melted butter and swirl to coat skillet. Add
2 tablespoons batter and swirl to coat bottom of skillet.
Cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is lightly golden, and
the top is still a little moist, about 1 minute. Swirl
skillet to loosen crÃªpe and gently flip with a spatula and
your fingers. Cook until golden, about 30 seconds. Transfer
to a plate. Repeat with remaining butter and batter. To make
the orange sauce: Combine orange juice, white sugar, and
orange zest in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook,
stirring often, until sugar is dissolved and the liquid
starts to bubble, 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually add butter,
piece by piece, stirring constantly, until it is melted and
fully incorporated. Let sauce come back up to a simmer and
let simmer until slightly syrupy, stirring occasionally,
about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in orange liqueur and salt.
Remove from the heat. Fold each crÃªpe in half, then half
again to make a triangle. Dip the folded crÃªpes into the hot
orange sauce. Place on a serving platter. Repeat with
remaining crÃªpes, overlapping each crÃªpe so they are facing
the same direction. To serve, pour orange liqueur into the
skillet with the remaining orange sauce and place over
medium-high. If it does not ignite automatically, use a
long-stemmed lighter and carefully set the liqueur on fire.
Let it burn for about 30 seconds. Pour the flaming liqueur
over the crÃªpes on the platter and serve immediately with
ice cream.

salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
4 large eggs
4 ounces halloumi cheese, sliced

1 cup cheesecake filling, such as PhiladelphiaÂ® Cheesecake No-Bak
1/4 cup lemon curd
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water

2 large eggs
1 pinch salt
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon water
salt to taste
2 tablespoons unsalted butter,

1 English muffin
1 teaspoon chives to garnish

Cooking Instructions

to cook and set more firmly once removed from the oven if
left in the hot ramekins. When eggs have 10 minutes cook
time remaining, make lemon butter sauce. Add lemon juice,
water, and salt to a small pan. Bring to a simmer over
medium heat, and simmer until liquid has reduced by about
half, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to lowest setting and add
butter slices. Start swirling and shaking the pan until
butter is almost fully emulsified, then turn off the heat.
Continue swirling pan until butter is entirely melted.
Taste; add cayenne or hot sauce if using. Keep pan in a warm
spot until needed. Sauce will thicken slightly as it cools
Toast and butter English muffins, transfer baked ham and
eggs onto muffin halves, and spoon warm sauce over. Sprinkle
with chives and serve immediately.

Strawberry Rhubarb Drop Biscuits


Ingredients
1 1/4 cups rhubarb
1 1/4 cups strawberries
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stick unsalted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons fruit syrup
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 large egg (optional)
2 teaspoons water (optional)
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into
1/4-inch pieces; place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries
and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss to combine, cover, and let
fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Combine
flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing
bowl; whisk to combine. Drain fruit in a strainer set over a
bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices that pass through. Grate
frozen butter into the flour mixture, while stirring with a
fork several times to coat butter pieces with flour. Add 1/4
cup sugar, and drained fruit, mixing with a fork until fruit
is coated with flour. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved
fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk. Mix with a fork just
until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough.
If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little
more buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a
little more flour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230
degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat. Scoop or
spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking
sheet. Whisk together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush
biscuits with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack
and let cool completely. Mix powdered sugar, lemon zest, and
lemon juice together in a small bowl for the lemon icing.
Fill icing into a piping bag or a plastic bag with the tip
cut off and drizzle icing over cooled biscuits.

Tres Leches Pancakes


Ingredients
2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/3 cup half and half

Cooking Instructions

Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and half
and half in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring

a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and lightly
coat with remaining vegetable oil. Add 1/4 cup of the batter

bubbles appear, pop, and leave small holes, 2 to 3 minutes.
Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on the other side,
about 2 minutes more. Serve pancakes warm with a drizzle of
the tres leches sauce, a dollop of whipped cream, and
sprinkle of cinnamon.

omelets


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Add eggs to a bowl, along with water, soy sauce, mirin,
salt, sugar, and cayenne. Use a fork to beat eggs until
whites are completely incorporated. Transfer egg mixture
into a pourable measuring cup. Set a 10-inch non-stick pan
over medium heat. Mix sesame and vegetable oil in a small
bowl, and use a brush to oil the pan. Pour in 1/3 of egg
mixture. Tilt the pan to cover the bottom with eggs. Cook
until omelet is about halfway set, then use a spatula to
turn over about 1 inch of edge toward the center on 3 sides
to square the shape on those 3 sides. If eggs seem to be
cooking too fast, reduce heat to medium-low. Use a spatula
to roll the omelet toward the rounder side, to form a
rectangular roll, about 2 inches wide by 8 inches long.
Slide omelet over to about 3 inches from the edge of the
pan, and brush more oil over the pan surface. Pour the
second 1/3 of eggs around the omelet. Lift omelet slightly
with the spatula so that some eggs flow underneath. Raise
heat back to medium, if it was reduced. When egg layer is
halfway set, use a spatula to roll this layer up and over
the already-folded omelet in the pan, and continue to roll
into a rectangle. Add remaining 1/3 of egg mixture, and
repeat cooking and rolling steps to make the final layer.
Transfer omelet onto plastic wrap, and use it to shape the
omelet, before wrapping and rolling it into a tight package;
cover with a towel and let rest for 5 minutes. Unwrap, slice
into 6 or 8 pieces, and serve on a warm plate. Sprinkle with
furikake.

(175 degrees C). Beat eggs with a stand mixer fitted with a
whisk attachment on medium speed until foamy, about 1
minute. Add white sugar; beat on medium speed until thick
and foamy, 4 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat milk in a large
saucepan over medium-low, stirring occasionally, until milk
begins to simmer. With mixer on low speed, slowly pour hot
milk into egg mixture, beating until fully combined, about
30 seconds. Return milk mixture to saucepan. Place saucepan
over medium-low heat, and cook, whisking constantly, until
mixture begins to simmer and thickens slightly, 3 to 4
minutes. Gradually whisk in semolina flour; cook, stirring
constantly, until thickened to a porridge consistency, 1 to
2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Gradually whisk cold
butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, into mixture in saucepan
until emulsified, about 2 minutes. Whisk in lemon zest,
lemon juice, and vanilla. Let custard stand at room
temperature while preparing baking pan, stirring
occasionally. Brush bottom and sides of a nonstick 13- x
9-inch baking pan with about 1 tablespoon of the melted
butter. Gently unfold and place phyllo sheets on a clean
work surface; cover using a damp clean kitchen towel to keep
phyllo moist while you work. Layer 8 phyllo sheets in the
prepared baking pan, lightly brushing each sheet with melted
butter. Spread custard over phyllo in an even layer. Top
with 2 phyllo sheets, lightly brushing each sheet with
melted butter and stretching sheets to cover sides of baking
pan. Working with remaining 8 phyllo sheets, 1 sheet at a
time, place phyllo sheet on work surface; lightly brush with
melted butter. Starting from 1 short end, fold phyllo sheet
accordion-style to create a long strip with 2-inch-wide
pleats. Place folded phyllo strip crosswise in baking pan
with pleats facing up. Repeat brushing and folding process
with remaining 7 phyllo sheets and melted butter, placing
strips side by side to completely cover baking pan. Bake in
the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and crispy,
40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven, and let bougatsa cool
slightly at room temperature for 30 minutes. Dust evenly
with confectioner's sugar and cinnamon. Slice into squares,
and serve warm or at room temperature.

Chocolate-Glazed Hazelnut Mousse Cake


Ingredients
2 tablespoons hazelnuts, toasted and skins rubbed off
3 tablespoons sugar
Â½ cup all-purpose flour
Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
â teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
3 tablespoons cold water
Â½ cup chocolate hazelnut spread such as Nutella
Â½ cup mascarpone
1 Â½ cups chilled heavy cream
2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
3 tablespoons sugar
5 tablespoons heavy cream
3 Â½ ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), chopped

Cooking Instructions

For shortbread base: Put oven rack in middle position and
preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Invert bottom of springform
pan (to make it easier to slide shortbread base off bottom),
then lock on side of pan and line bottom with a round of
parchment paper. Pulse hazelnuts with sugar in a food
processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add flour, butter,
cocoa, and salt and pulse just until a dough forms. Press
dough evenly onto bottom of springform pan with your
fingers. Prick all over with a fork, then bake until just
dry to the touch, about 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer base in
pan to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Remove
side of pan and carefully slide out parchment from under
shortbread, then reattach side of pan around shortbread
base. Make mousse while shortbread cools: Sprinkle gelatin
over water in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan and let
stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Heat gelatin mixture
over low heat, stirring, just until gelatin is melted, about
2 minutes. Whisk in chocolate hazelnut spread until combined
and remove from heat. Whisk together mascarpone and
chocolate hazelnut mixture in a large bowl. Beat together
cream, cocoa powder, and sugar in another large bowl with an
electric mixer at low speed until just combined, then
increase speed to high and beat until cream just holds soft
peaks. Whisk one third of whipped cream into mascarpone
mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whipped cream
until well combined. Spoon filling onto shortbread base in
pan, gently smoothing top, then chill, covered, at least 3
hours. Make ganache and glaze cake: Bring cream to a simmer
in a small heavy saucepan and remove from heat. Add
chocolate and let stand 1 minute, then gently whisk until
completely melted and smooth. Transfer ganache to a small
bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until slightly
thickened but still pourable, about 20 minutes. Run a warm
thin knife around inside of springform pan, then remove
side. Slide cake off bottom of pan and transfer to a serving
plate. Pour ganache onto top of cake and spread, allowing
excess ganache to drip down sides.

Lemon Coconut Cake


Ingredients
6 large egg yolks,
2/3 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons lemon zest
3/4 cup lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes
3 cups cake flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup sour cream,
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup coconut milk
6 large egg whites,
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
4 cups confectioner's sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon coconut milk
1 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes

Cooking Instructions

For lemon curd, add egg yolks, sugar, lemon zest, lemon
juice, salt, and butter to a small non-reactive saucepan
over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until
mixture begins to simmer and has thickened, 8 to 12 minutes.
Pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl,
using a spatula or wooden spoon to push the mixture through.
Cover with a piece of plastic wrap directly touching the top
of the curd, and refrigerate until chilled. For cakes,
preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease 3 8-inch round cake pans, and line the bottoms with
parchment paper. Place coconut flakes into a food processor
or blender, and pulse a few times until coconut flakes are
finely chopped. Set aside. Sift cake flour, baking powder,
salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. In a separate
large bowl, beat butter, vegetable oil, and sugar together
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 4
minutes. Add in sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and mix
until thoroughly combined. Add in 1/2 of flour mixture and
mix until just combined. Add in coconut milk and mix until
just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until
just combined. In a separate clean bowl, combine egg whites
and cream of tartar. With clean beaters, beat egg whites on
medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.
Add 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the batter, and fold
just until no streaks of whites remain. Add in remaining egg
white mixture and gently fold until no streaks of white
remain. Divide batter evenly between the 3 prepared cake
pans. Bake in the preheated oven until tops of cakes spring
back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cakes to
cool in pans for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack
to cool completely. For frosting, cut cold butter into
1/2-inch pieces. Place into a bowl. Starting on low speed,
beat butter with an electric mixer until just loosened.
Gradually increase the mixer speed, and beat butter until
smooth, about 2 minutes. Add in cold cream cheese, and beat
on medium-high speed until completely smooth and combined,
about 3 minutes. Add in confectionerâs sugar; beat until
thoroughly combined. Add in lemon zest, vanilla, and salt
and mix until combined. Add in remaining confectionerâs
sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add in 1 tablespoon cold coconut milk and beat mixture on
medium-high speed for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. If
frosting is a bit too soft to spread onto the cake layers,
place it into the fridge for about 10 minutes, or until it
is easier to use. To assemble the cake, place one cake layer
onto a cake plate or serving platter. Spread a thin layer of
cream cheese frosting over the top of the cake. Pipe a ring
of frosting around the top edge of the cake. Place about 2
tablespoons of lemon curd in the center of the frosting
ring, and smooth into an even layer. Stack another cake
layer on top of the first, and repeat the process of
frosting and filling. When the last cake layer is stacked on
top, frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer
of frosting. Use your hands to press the toasted coconut
flakes onto the sides of the cake. If desired, drizzle or
swirl the top of cake with some of the extra lemon curd.
Place cake into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes
before serving.

oven for about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, carefully
remove the foil and weights, and let cool to room
temperature, about 20 minutes. The base of the crust will
have turned a very light golden brown. Reduce the oven
temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). For custard:
combine eggs, white sugar, and brown sugar in a bowl, and
whisk vigorously until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.
Add flour, cornmeal, salt, vanilla, vinegar, milk, and
butter, and whisk vigorously until you achieve a smooth,
emulsified batter, about 2 minutes. Arrange 12 peach slices
on the bottom of the crust. Whisk batter again, and slowly
ladle into the crust, being careful not to move the peach
slices out of place. Bake in the preheated oven at 350
degrees F (175 degrees C) until top is browned and a very
sharp knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 50 to
60 minutes. The pie should not be liquid, but jiggle when
the pie dish is moved back and forth. Let cool completely
before serving. For best results, chill in the refrigerator
before serving.

Perfect Cheesecake with Strawberry Topping


Ingredients
14 graham crackers
1/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, melted
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs
2 quarts fresh strawberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup water

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Break
graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor. Add sugar
and pulse until large crumbs form. Add butter and pulse just
until combined and mixture resembles slightly wet sand.
Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan; press mixture
lightly into the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of the
pan. Bake in the preheated oven until fragrant and slightly
golden brown around the edges, about 8 minutes. Let cool.
Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil. Place cream cheese
in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using a paddle attachment,
whip cheese on medium speed just until smooth, to avoid
incorporating too much air. Add sugar and beat until smooth,
scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add in sour
cream, vanilla, lemon juice and salt and blend until just
combined. With the mixer on low speed, add eggs, one at a
time, mixing until each egg is fully incorporated, then mix
until just combined and smooth, scraping down the sides of
the bowl as needed. Pour mixture into the prepared crust.
Wrap bottom and sides of pan well with heavy duty aluminum
foil. Place the pan inside a large deep roasting pan and set
pan in the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the
roasting pan around the cheesecake without letting any water
inside the foil wrap or the cheesecake. Bake in the
preheated oven until the center is very slightly jiggly,
about 50 minutes. Carefully remove pans from the oven and
allow cheesecake to cool in the water bath for 15 to 20
minutes. After about 10 minutes, just when cheesecake starts
to release itself from the sides, run a knife around the
sides. Remove wrapped cheesecake from water bath and place
on a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Unwrap
cheesecake and place in refrigerator until fully chilled and
ready to serve, at least 4 hours. Place 1/2 of strawberries
in a large saucepan and stir in sugar, lemon, vanilla,
cornstarch, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat,
stirring often. Reduce heat to medium high and allow mixture
to simmer until berries are softened. Using a potato masher,
mash strawberries until slightly chunky; continue to simmer
until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in
remaining strawberries, and let cool to room temperature.
Refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve cheesecake slices
with strawberry topping.

S'mores Cupcakes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
6 tablespoons brown sugar
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch cinnamon
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon espresso powder
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup brown sugar
1 large egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup sour cream
18 large marshmallows
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
2/3 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon almond extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2
cupcake pans with liners. Prepare the crust: Mix graham
cracker crumbs, melted butter, brown sugar, salt, nutmeg,
and cinnamon together in a small bowl until combined. Place
1 packed tablespoon of crumb mixture into the bottom of
about 18 cupcake liners and press into an even layer. Bake
in the preheated oven until graham cracker crusts are
slightly darker in color, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow crusts to
cool. Prepare cupcakes: Whisk boiling water, cocoa powder,
and espresso powder together In a small bowl or measuring
cup until smooth and combined. Set aside to cool slightly.
Beat butter, vegetable oil, and brown sugar in a large bowl
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3
minutes. Add in egg, vanilla, and salt. Beat for an
additional 3 minutes on medium-high speed. Add in cocoa
powder mixture and beat until thoroughly incorporated. Add
in cake flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and mix until
just combined. Add in sour cream; mix until just combined.
Spoon about 2 heaped tablespoons of cake batter over each
graham cracker crust, making sure to fill each liner no more
than 2/3 full. (There may be extra batter to make 1 or 2
extra cupcakes without a graham cracker crust. Simply put
that batter into an empty liner, filling no more than 2/3
full, and bake as a plain chocolate cupcake). Bake in the
preheated oven, 1 pan at a time, until tops of the cupcakes
spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow
cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before carefully
removing to a wire rack to cool completely. To prepare
frosting, place an oven rack directly below the oven's
broiler; preheat broiler. Line a baking sheet with parchment
paper and lightly grease it. Place large marshmallows about
1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Place pan under broiler
and cook until marshmallows are golden brown and puffy,
rotating the pan often to ensure the tops of the
marshmallows brown evenly without burning, about 1 minute.
Remove pan from oven and allow marshmallows to cool. Place
egg whites, white sugar, cold water, cream of tartar, and
pinch of salt in a very large heatproof mixing bowl. Place
the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water (do not allow
the bottom of the bowl to touch the water), and begin to
beat the mixture on low speed with an electric hand mixer.
Gradually increase speed to medium-high and continue to whip
mixture over hot water until mixture holds stiff peaks, 8 to
10 minutes. Remove from heat and beat for 1 minute more. Add
in toasted marshmallows, vanilla, and almond extract.
Beginning on low speed and gradually increasing the speed to
high, beat mixture until completely smooth and no lumps of
toasted marshmallow remain, and the mixture once again holds
stiff peaks, 5 to 7 minutes. Place mixture into a large
piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Generously pipe
marshmallow frosting onto the top of each cooled cupcake. If
desired, use a kitchen torch to caramelize the frosting
until golden brown.

needed to fit. Spread remaining 3 cups pudding mixture over
crackers. Store, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 8
hours or up to overnight. Before serving, top with remaining
2 cups sliced bananas. Drizzle with salted caramel sauce and
sprinkle flaky sea salt. Cut into slices and serve drizzled

1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar

time, until tops of cupcakes spring back when lightly
touched, 22 to 26 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan
for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool
completely, about 30 minutes Chill cupcakes in the
refrigerator for about 1 hour. This will make them easier to
cut and fill. Cream cheese whipped cream: Beat chilled cream
cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt together until
smooth. Add in 1/2 cup cold heavy cream, and mix on low
until mixture is smooth. Add in remaining heavy cream; beat
on medium-high until mixture holds stiff peaks. If desired,
place mixture into a piping bag fitted with an open star tip
(such as a WiltonÂ® 1M). Place piping bag in refrigerator
until ready to use. Remove cupcakes from refrigerator.
Remove the liners and cut tops off cupcakes. Pipe a layer of
whipped cream on bottom half of cupcakes; top with about 1
to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. Place tops of cupcakes
back on, and lightly press down to adhere. Pipe more whipped
cream on top of cupcakes and top with another 1 to 2
teaspoons strawberry mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for
30 minutes before serving.

2 cups fresh strawberries
6 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 1/4 cups OreoÂ® cookies
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
16 small strawberries
4 OreoÂ® cookies
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
1 pinch ground nutmeg
3 large eggs

Cooking Instructions

Strawberry sauce: Place strawberries, sugar, lemon juice,
and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook,
stirring often, until strawberries soften and release their
juices, about 10 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash
strawberries. Stir water and cornstarch together in a small
bowl. Add cornstarch mixture to strawberries, and cook,
stirring constantly, until mixture begins to thicken, 1 to 2
minutes more. Remove from heat, and carefully pour mixture
through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl; use the back of a
wooden spoon or spatula to press out as much juice as
possible. Discard pulp. Place strawberry sauce, uncovered,
into the refrigerator to cool. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom of a
9-inch springform pan. Oreo crust: Combine cookie crumbs,
brown sugar, and salt. Stir in melted butter until
thoroughly combined. Press mixture evenly into the bottom
and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Place pan on a
rimmed baking sheet. Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15
minutes. Remove from the oven, leaving oven on, and allow to
cool for 10 minutes. Cheesecake filling: Beat cream cheese
and sugar until thoroughly smooth and combined. Add in heavy
cream, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, almond extract,
and nutmeg; beat on low speed until smooth. Add in eggs, and
beat on low speed just until eggs are incorporated. Pour
half of filling into crust. Drizzle 6 tablespoons of cooled
strawberry sauce over filling. Pour remaining filling into
the pan, taking care to cover strawberry sauce. Reserve
remaining strawberry sauce, covered, in the refrigerator
until ready to serve the cheesecake. Return cheesecake to
the oven and bake until the top looks set, and edges are
beginning to turn golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Turn oven
off, prop the door slightly ajar, and leave cheesecake to
cool in the oven for 1 hour. Remove cheesecake to a wire
rack. Run a knife around the top edge of cheesecake to
loosen it slightly from the pan; allow to cool in the pan to
room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8
hours. When ready to serve, toss halved strawberries into
reserved strawberry sauce until thoroughly coated. Remove
cheesecake from springform pan; place on a serving platter.
Pour strawberries and sauce on top of the cake, and turn all
the berries cut-side-down. Garnish with halved Oreos, if
desired. Keep extra cheesecake stored in the fridge.

Tartufo


Ingredients
1 quart vanilla ice cream (such as Haagen Dazs
8 maraschino cherries (such as Luxardo
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
5 tablespoons coconut oil
36 chocolate wafer cookies chocolate wafer cookies
1/2 cup roasted pistachios (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Let ice cream stand at room
temperature until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Line
8 small bowls with plastic wrap, leaving a 3-inch overhang.
Using a 2 oz. (1/4-cup) ice-cream scoop, place 1 scoop of
ice cream into the bottom of each bowl. Gently press a
maraschino cherry into the top of each ice-cream scoop, then
top each with another 2 oz. (1/4-cup) scoop of ice cream.
Working with 1 bowl of ice cream at a time, gather
overhanging plastic, wrap it up around ice cream, and gently
twist it to form a ball. Freeze until ice cream is firm and
set, about 2 hours. Place chocolate chips in a large
microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on HIGH in (30-second)
intervals, stirring thoroughly between intervals, until
melted, 3 to 4 minutes total. Whisk in coconut oil until oil
is completely melted and mixture is combined. Let cool
slightly at room temperature, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
pulse cookies and pistachios, if using, in a food processor
until finely ground, about 15 quick pulses. Transfer to a
shallow bowl, and set aside at room temperature. Working
with 1 ice-cream ball at a time, remove ice-cream ball from
freezer. Remove plastic wrap, and place ice-cream ball on a
wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Pour chocolate
mixture over ice-cream ball, allowing it to thinly coat the
top and sides. If coating in cookie mixture, quickly and
carefully invert chocolate-coated ice-cream ball into cookie
mixture, rolling until evenly coated. Transfer coated ice
cream ball to a clean wire rack set inside a large, rimmed
baking sheet in the freezer. Repeat process with remaining 7
ice-cream balls, returning to the freezer after each one.
Freeze until set, about 1 hour, or until ready to serve.

These Copycat Choco Tacos Taste Just Like the Real Thing


Ingredients
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup egg whites
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup water
vanilla fudge swirl ice cream
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup unsalted peanuts

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Stand a thin hard cover book up
straight with the hard edge facing upwards. Drape a sheet of
parchment across the book (this is what you will use to
shape the shells). Line a plate with parchment paper. Heat
butter in a small saucepan over medium-low until melted, 2
to 3 minutes. Transfer the melted butter to a bowl, then
whisk in brown sugar, egg whites, vanilla to taste, and 1/2
teaspoon salt. Add flour and water. Whisk until the batter
is smooth and no clumps remain. Heat a non-stick skillet
over medium. Pour about 1 tablespoon batter into the pan;
spread into a thin layer with a spoon. Cook until browned on
the bottom and bubbles begin to form on top, 1 to 2 minutes.
Flip and cook until browned on other side, 1 to 2 minutes
more. Remove from pan and immediately drape over parchment-
lined book, pressing to help form that taco shell shape.
Transfer to a parchment-lined plate and repeat with
remaining batter. Let cool completely before filling.
Alternatively, preheat a waffle cone maker according to
manufacturer's instructions. Pour batter into the preheated
waffle maker and cook according to instructions. Remove from
pan and immediately drape across the parchment-lined book.
Let cool completely before filling. Remove ice cream from
the freezer and let soften for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile,
combine chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe
bowl; microwave in 30-second intervals, mixing well between
each, until mixture is melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in chopped peanuts. Carefully fill the taco shells with
the ice cream, pressing down gently to evenly distribute the
ice cream to the edges. Repeat with the remaining taco
shells. Place back on the parchment-lined plate. Dip the top
of each ice cream taco in the peanut-chocolate mixture to
completely coat the exposed ice cream. Return to the
parchment-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining tacos until
all are dipped. Once chocolate has hardened, carefully place
Choco Tacos in a sealable container or bag and return to
freezer.

Vanilla Crème Brûlée


Ingredients
3 large egg yolks
Â¼ cup superfine sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla bean paste
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon superfine sugar

Cooking Instructions

Place egg yolks in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer on
high speed until eggs are thick and light yellow, about 5
minutes. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup sugar and vanilla bean
paste. Pour cream into the top of a double boiler over
simmering water and simmer until just hot to the touch,
about 3 minutes. Pour 1/2 of the warmed cream into the egg
mixture, a little at a time, whisking constantly so eggs do
not curdle. Pour egg yolk-cream mixture into the remaining
cream in the double boiler. Cook over medium heat, stirring
continuously, until mixture thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Do
not let mixture boil. Pour custard into 4 small ramekins and
refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours, up to 24 hours.
Sprinkle each crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e with some of the remaining
tablespoon of superfine sugar. Use a blowtorch to melt the
sugar on top of the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. It will crystallize as it
hardens. Alternatively you can use the oven broiler, but be
careful to not burn the sugar. Lightly tap the crystallized
sugar with the back of a spoon to break it before eating.

Wild Raspberry Mousse


Ingredients
3 cups raspberries
1/2 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1 pinch salt
1 1/4 teaspoons gelatin
3 tablespoons water
1/2 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

stirring often, until gelatin is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes.
Pour strained berry juice back into the pan with gelatin,
and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until just
beginning to simmer. Remove from heat, and stir in yogurt
until completely smooth and combined. Let mixture cool to
room temperature. Beat cream and vanilla together In a large
bowl until cream holds stiff peaks. Stir 1/4 of whipped
cream into cooled berry mixture, then fold berry mixture
into remaining whipped cream until smooth and combined. Pour
mousse into serving containers. Cover lightly with plastic
wrap; refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours to
overnight.

banana pudding


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Separate eggs, placing the whites in the bowl of a stand
mixer and the yolks into a saucepan. Prepare the custard:
Add sugar, salt, and 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour to the
yolks. Splash in about 1/4 of the milk and start blending
mixture with a whisk. Pour in remaining milk and whisk until
smooth. Cook and stir mixture over medium heat until hot to
the touch, occasionally dipping your finger in to test.
Whisk constantly until custard is thick enough to form
ribbons. Remove custard from heat and add banana liqueur,
vanilla, then cold butter. Whisk until butter dissolves. Set
custard aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200
degrees C). Begin to assemble the pudding: Toss banana
slices with lemon juice. Spread 1/4 of the custard over the
bottom of a baking dish. Add a single layer of vanilla
wafers. Cover with 1/2 of the bananas and spread 1/2 of the
remaining custard on top. Add another layer of vanilla
wafers, using slightly fewer this time. Top with remaining
bananas and custard. Smooth the top and tap dish against the
counter to settle the pudding. Make the meringue topping:
Add cream of tartar to the egg whites. Beat using the whisk
attachment until foamy. Gradually add sugar and beat until
stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Spread meringue over the
pudding using a soft spatula, creating ridges for contrast.
Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is nicely browned,
7 to 10 minutes. Serve warm or chilled.
