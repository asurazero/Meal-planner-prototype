Grilled Bacon Pizza


Ingredients
1 pound pizza dough
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/3 up bacon jam
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella
1/4 cup ricotta cheese
1/3 cup bacon
1/4 cup arugula, torn
2 tablespoons pesto
1 tablespoon balsamic glaze
2 tablespoons ricotta salata

Cooking Instructions

Preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15
minutes. Shape pizza dough and brush with olive oil. Reduce
the flame on half of the grill burners to Low, to create
areas of direct and indirect heat. Carefully place dough,
olive oil side facing down, onto the grill over direct heat.
Close the cover. Let dough grill until the bottom is just
barely cooked and shows char marks, 1 to 3 minutes. Flip
dough over and cook 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove dough to a
baking sheet. Spread bacon jam over pizza dough; sprinkle
mozzarella cheese over dough. Place small dollops of ricotta
cheese onto pizza. Scatter cooked bacon pieces over the
pizza. Return pizza to grill and cook until cheese has
melted, 3 to 4 more minutes. Scatter small pieces of arugula
onto pizza. Add pesto; drizzle with balsamic glaze. Scatter
ricotta salata crumbles over pizza. Cut into wedges and
serve.
