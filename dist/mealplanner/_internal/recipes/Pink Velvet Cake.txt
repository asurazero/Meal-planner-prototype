Pink Velvet Cake


Ingredients
baking spray with flour
1 (15.25-ounce) package white cake mix
1 cup whole buttermilk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 large eggs
6 drops soft pink food coloring gel
1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese
1/4 cup unsalted butter
4 cups powdered sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
sprinkles

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Lightly coat a 9x13-inch baking pan with
baking spray; set aside. Whisk together cake mix,
buttermilk, oil, eggs, and food coloring in a medium bowl
until fully combined and no dry streaks remain. Transfer to
the prepared baking pan and spread in an even layer. Bake in
the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in center
comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely in
pan on a wire rack, about 1 hour. Beat cream cheese and
butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until light
and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually beat in powdered sugar
with mixer on low speed, until smooth and fully combined,
stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed, about 3
minutes. Add vanilla and salt and beat until just combined.
Using an offset spatula, spread cream cheese frosting evenly
over the top of the cooled cake. Garnish with sprinkles, if
desired. Cut into squares and serve.
