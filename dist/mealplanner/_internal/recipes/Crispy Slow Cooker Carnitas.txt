Crispy Slow Cooker Carnitas


Ingredients
4 pounds pork shoulder
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 orange, cut in half, juiced and peel reserved
1 lime, juiced lime
1 white onion, quartered
2 bay leaves
tortillas

Cooking Instructions

Cut pork into 5 to 6 large chunks. Season each piece evenly
with salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, and cumin.
Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add pork in a
single layer to the hot skillet. If meat does not fit, do
this step in 2 batches. Cook pork, untouched until well
browned on the first side, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook
another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove meat and place into the
bottom of a slow cooker. To the hot skillet, add onion and
cook 1 minute. Deglaze pan with orange juice, lime juice,
and 1 1/4 cups water and scrape up any browned bits from the
bottom of the skillet. Pour water mixture over pork in the
slow cooker, add bay leaves, and cover. Cook on High for 4
to 5 hours or on Low 6 to 7 hours or until pork is very
tender. Preheat the oven to broil. Remove pork from the slow
cooker and shred into approximately 2 to 3 inch pieces and
place on a rimmed baking sheet. Spoon some of the juices
evenly over the pork, and reserve about 1 cup of juices for
serving. Broil pork for 3 to 5 minutes, or until slightly
crispy and browned, tossing halfway through if necessary.
Serve in toasted tortillas with japaleno slices, chopped
onion, cilantro, and lime wedges, or as desired
