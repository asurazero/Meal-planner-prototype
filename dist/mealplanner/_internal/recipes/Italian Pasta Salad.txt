Italian Pasta Salad


Ingredients
1 (12 ounce) package tri-color rotini pasta
¾ pound Italian salami, finely diced
½ green bell pepper, sliced
½ red bell pepper, sliced
½ red onion, chopped
1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives
8 ounces small fresh mozzarella balls (ciliegine)
1 cup Italian-style salad dressing
3 (.7 ounce) packages dry Italian-style salad dressing mix, or to taste
½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Bring a large pot of lightly salted
water to a boil. Cook rotini pasta at a boil until tender
yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with

salad dressing and toss to coat. Season pasta salad with dry
salad dressing mix and stir to combine. Sprinkle with
Parmesan cheese before serving. Enjoy!
