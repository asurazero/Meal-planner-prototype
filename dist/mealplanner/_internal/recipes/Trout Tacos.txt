Trout Tacos


Ingredients
16 white corn tortillas
1/2 pound purple cabbage
2 green onions
1/2 pound coleslaw mix
3 tablespoons Mexican crema
1 teaspoon lime zest
lime wedges as needed, divided
2 tablespoons cilantro leaves
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 filets trout
3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon tapioca starch
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons chipotle powder
1 teaspoon Mexican oregano
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup prepared guacamole, or as needed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Wrap
tortillas in foil. Bake tortillas in the preheated oven
until warm, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place cabbage, white
parts of green onion, coleslaw mix, 3 tablespoons Mexican
crema, lime zest, juice of 2 lime wedges, and cilantro in a
large bowl. Toss to coat; season with salt and pepper. Set
aside.. Carefully remove skin from trout. Cut each trout
filet into 2- to 3-inch pieces. Stir tapioca starch, cumin,
chipotle powder, and Mexican oregano together in a shallow
bowl. Dip fish pieces into seasoning mixture to coat. Heat
oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add
coated fish pieces; cook until golden brown and fish flakes
easily with a fork, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a
drip tray, and season with salt. Using 2 corn tortillas for
each taco, divide fish, slaw, and guacamole between the
tacos. Garnish each with green tops of scallions. Serve with
remaining lime wedges and crema on the side. Enjoy!
