1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 (8 ounce) flat iron steak, patted dry
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt,
1/2 teaspoon black pepper,
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons olive oil
8 large eggs
1 (11 ounce) package tortilla chips
2 (8 ounce) packages shredded Mexican cheese blend (such as Tilamook

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. For chimichurri: Place cilantro,
parsley, garlic, vinegar, crushed red pepper, and salt in a
small food processor; pulse until finely chopped, about 10
pulses. With processor running, pour oil through food chute,
and process until fully incorporated, about 20 seconds; set
aside. For steak: Sprinkle steak evenly with 1/2 teaspoon of
the salt, 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper, and cumin, as
desired. Heat a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high
for 5 minutes. Add steak and 1 tablespoon of the oil,
swirling to distribute oil evenly. Cook, undisturbed, until
nicely browned and a thermometer inserted into thickest
portion of steak registers 120 degreed F (49 degrees ) for
rare, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board,
and let rest 10 minutes. Do not wipe skillet clean.
Meanwhile, whisk together eggs and remaining 1/4 teaspoon
each salt and black pepper in a medium bowl until thoroughly
blended. Heat cast-iron skillet over medium. Add remaining 1
tablespoon oil and eggs; cook, stirring occasionally, until
just set, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl; cover, and
set aside. Preheat the oven’s broiler and place a rack about
12 inches from the heat source. Line a large rimmed baking
sheet with aluminum foil. To assemble nachos, arrange half
of tortilla chips in an even layer on prepared baking sheet.
Thinly slice steak across the grain, and cut into 3/4-inch
pieces. Sprinkle tortilla chips evenly with half of steak,
half of beans, half of eggs, and half of Mexican blend
cheese. Repeat with remaining chips, steak, beans, eggs, and
cheese. Broil until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 2
minutes. Top with tomatoes, avocado, and pickled jalapeños.
Drizzle evenly with chimichurri, and serve with sour cream.
