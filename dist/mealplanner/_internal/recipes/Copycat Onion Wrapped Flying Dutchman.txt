Copycat Onion Wrapped Flying Dutchman


Ingredients
1 large white onion
3/4 pound ground beef round
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 slices merican cheese, cut into thirds
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 teaspoon mustard
1 tablespoon pickle relish

Cooking Instructions

Cut 4 1/2 -inch thick slices from the center portion of the
onion and discard the smaller ends for another use. Divide
beef into 4 portions and form each portion into a very thin
patty. Season patties with salt and pepper. Heat a large
skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add 2
onion slices to the pan and cook, undisturbed, about 2
minutes. Add 2 patties and continue to cook until golden
brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip onion and burger patties and
continue to cook until golden brown pressing the burger as
it cooks. Add 2 cheese slices to the top of one onion slice
and both burger patties. Place one burger on the cheese-
topped onion slice and top with the second burger patty.
Place remaining onion slice over burger and press down. Flip
burger and cook 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove from pan and set
aside. Repeat with remaining onions, burger patties and
cheese. Combine mayo, ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish in
a small bowl and stir well. Serve with burgers.
