Sloppy Joe Smash Burgers


Ingredients
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
1/3 cup onion
1/3 cup green bell pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup Sloppy Joe sauce
2 slices American cheese
2 hamburger buns

Cooking Instructions

Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium high heat. Add
oil, onion, and bell pepper; season with garlic powder and
cook, stirring constantly, until softened and browned around
the edges, about 5 minutes. Arrange onion mixture into 4
mounds. Divide beef into 4 portions and place each portion
over a mound of peppers and onions. Using a flat spatula,
press down firmly on each section to form thin patties.
Season evenly with salt and pepper and cook, undisturbed,
until browned on the bottom and around the edges, about 3
minutes. Flip burgers and top each with 2 tablespoons of
Sloppy Joe sauce. Place cheese slices over two of the
burgers and top with remaining 2 burgers. Toast each bun in
pan drippings and add stacked burgers to buns. Serve with
more sauce if desired.
