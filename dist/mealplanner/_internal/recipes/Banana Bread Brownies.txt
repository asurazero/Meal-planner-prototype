Banana Bread Brownies


Ingredients
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 ounces dark chocolate, broken into pieces
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 large egg
2 bananas, mashed (about 1 cup)
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
12 slices banana (optional)
2 tablespoons white sugar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Generously butter a 9x9-inch square pan. A piece of
parchment paper can also be added to the bottom of the pan
to prevent sticking. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Melt chocolate
in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second
intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an
electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg, vanilla, and
mashed banana, and beat until combined. Add chocolate, and
beat until mixture is well combined and smooth. Use a
spatula to mix in walnuts and chocolate chips, then use the
spatula to mix in flour just until flour disappears.
Transfer batter into the prepared pan and smooth top. Place
banana slices on top, evenly spaced in a grid pattern. Bake
in the preheated oven until a skewer comes out almost clean
but with some batter on the very tip. If you want fudgier
brownies, do not overcook. Let brownies cool in the pan.
Cover, refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour, and serve
chilled. For optional banana brûlée: While brownies are
cooling, cover each banana slice with a half teaspoon of
sugar. Use a propane kitchen torch to melt the sugar until
dark brown and bubbling. Be careful not to char the edges of
the crust around the banana too much. This banana brûlée
step can also be done before the brownies go into the oven.
