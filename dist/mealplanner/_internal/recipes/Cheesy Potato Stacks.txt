Cheesy Potato Stacks


Ingredients
1 pound ukon gold potatoes,
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place
potato slices in a large bowl. In a separate bowl whisk
olive oil, salt, parsley, garlic powder, and pepper until
smooth. Pour the olive oil mixture over the potatoes. Toss
to coat. Using a muffin pan, stack potato slices into 8 of
the muffin molds. They should reach the top of the mold but
not overflow. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes.
Divide cheese over the top of the 8 stacks. Bake until
cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more. Remove the stacks
using a spoon and serve immediately.
