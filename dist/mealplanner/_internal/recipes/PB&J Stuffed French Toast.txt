PB&J Stuffed French Toast


Ingredients
8 slices brioche bread
1/4 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup jelly
3 large eggs
1/2 cup whole milk
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 butter, divided
1/2 tablespoon powdered sugar, or to taste (for dusting)

Cooking Instructions

Spread 1 tablespoon peanut butter over the center of 4
slices of bread, taking care not to spread it all the way to
the edges. Repeat with remaining bread slices and jelly.
Place peanut butter slices on top of the jelly slices to
make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Whisk eggs, milk,
and cinnamon together in a shallow dish until well combined.
Place one sandwich in egg mixture, allowing it to soak
through just slightly. Flip and repeat. Heat 1 tablespoon
butter in a skillet over medium heat. Place sandwich into
skillet and cook until golden and lightly toasted, about 4
minutes. Flip and repeat until egg is cooked through and the
sandwich is toasted on both sides. Repeat with the remaining
sandwiches, egg mixture, and butter. Dust with powdered
sugar and serve immediately.
