Prosciutto Plum Focaccia


Ingredients
1 packet active dry yeast
1 cup water
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon white sugar
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
12 slices plum
4 slices prosciutto
2 teaspoons rosemary
1 teaspoon sea salt

Cooking Instructions

Stir yeast and warm water together in a large bowl and let
stand for 15 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, sugar,
all-purpose flour, and salt. Use a wooden spoon to stir
until a very soft, sticky dough forms. While stirring,
incorporate any dough that sticks to the sides of the bowl.
Drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub some on your
hands. Pick up dough, and with your fingers under the dough
pushing gently up, stretch the sides down and under several
times while rotating the dough, in order to form a
relatively smooth ball with some surface tension on top.
Place dough ball into the bowl, smooth side up, cover the
bowl, and refrigerate overnight. The next morning, pull out
dough and let rise at room temperature until doubled in
size, about 1 1/2 hours. Generously oil a work surface with
about 1 tablespoon olive oil, and transfer dough to the work
surface. Press into a large rectangle, and then fold into
thirds one way, and then the other, forming a small
rectangle, about 6x9 inches. Generously oil a sheet pan with
about 2 tablespoons olive oil, and transfer dough rectangle
to the sheet pan. Press dough out to about 1/2-inch thick.
Cover; let proof at room temperature until dough has spread
out, risen slightly, and surface has bubbles, 1 1/2 to 2
hours. Meanwhile, wrap plum sections with prosciutto and
refrigerate until needed. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F
(245 degrees C). Sprinkle dough with rosemary. Push wrapped
plum sections deep into the dough in a 3x4 pattern. Drizzle
top lightly with olive oil; sprinkle with sea salt. Bake in
the preheated oven until browned, 17 to 20 minutes. As soon
as focaccia is out of the oven, brush with more olive oil if
desired. Transfer focaccia to a rack and let cool completely
before cutting.
