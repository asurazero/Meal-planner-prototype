The Ultimate Brunch Casserole


Ingredients
1 pound hashbrowns
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound chorizo
1 yellow onion
12 eggs
3 cups grated cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups sour cream
1 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
1 cup green onions
1 avocado
1/2 cup pickled jalapeños

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C). Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Spread
hash browns over the bottom of the baking dish. Heat olive
oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chorizo and
onion, using a flat wooden spoon to break up the meat into
smaller pieces. Cook until browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.
Set aside. Whisk eggs, 2 cups Cheddar cheese, 1 cup sour
cream, milk, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Stir in
chorizo mixture. Pour egg mixture over hash browns in baking
dish. Dollop remaining 1/2 cup sour cream over eggs, and
sprinkle with remaining 1 cup cheese. Bake for 35 to 45
minutes, until just set in the center. Sprinkle with green
onions, avocado, and pickled jalapeños, if using. Cut into
squares and serve immediately.
