Rough Puff Pastry


Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
½ teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
½ cup cold water

Cooking Instructions

Place flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted
with a paddle attachment. Add butter and toss with your
fingertips until evenly coated with flour. Add water to
bowl. Mix on low speed until the dough forms a shaggy mass,
about 45 seconds. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and
refrigerate until butter is firm but not brittle, about 20
minutes. Transfer dough to a floured work surface and roll
into a ½-inch-thick rectangle that is about 10 ½ x 6 inches.
Fold one third of the longer side of the dough over the
center third of dough. Fold the final third over the center
(like you would fold a letter). Tightly wrap folded dough in
plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 30
minutes. Repeat this process of rolling, folding and
refrigerating 4 more times, turning the dough 90 degrees
each time before rolling. After completing the final fold,
wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until
firm before using, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.
