Aburi Steak


Ingredients
1 (12 ounce boneless rib eye steak
1/2 cup white rice
3/4 cup water
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 tablespoon sambal oelek
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/3 cup sour cream
1/4 teaspoon lime zest
2 teaspoons lime juice
2 teaspoons wasabi paste, or more to taste
2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds

Cooking Instructions

Put steak on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Freeze until
just firm, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, for sushi rice, rinse
rice under cold running water, rubbing grains together with
your fingers. Combine rice and water in a small saucepan.
Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, until
tender and sticky, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir
together vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Stir into
rice. Cover; let cool about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, thinly
slice steak across the grain into 24 (1/4-inch-thick)
slices. Transfer steak to a zip-top bag set in a shallow
dish. Whisk together soy sauce, maple syrup, chili paste,
and oil in a small bowl. Pour over steak in bag; seal bag.
Chill at least 20 minutes or up to 2 hours. For sauce, whisk
together sour cream, lime zest, lime juice, and wasabi
paste. Shape rice with wet hands into 24 (1-tablespoon)
oval-shaped portions. Drain steak; discard marinade. Put
steak on a foil-lined baking sheet set on a wire rack. Char
steak with a kitchen torch, turning once, until desired
doneness, about 5 minutes for entire recipe. Put 1 steak
piece on each rice portion. Sprinkle with furikake seasoning
and serve with sauce.
