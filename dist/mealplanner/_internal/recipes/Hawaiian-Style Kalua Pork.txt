Hawaiian-Style Kalua Pork


Ingredients
1 4 1/2 pound) pork shoulder roast
4 teaspoons liquid hickory smoke
3 tablespoons sea salt
1 (!4 ounce) package banana leaves, thawed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place
pork in a large bowl and rub all over with liquid smoke.
Sprinkle salt over meat, and rub in until evenly coated. Set
aside. Place banana leaves on the counter, arranging them in
a spiral, overlapping pattern, so once pork is placed on the
leaves, they can be folded up and over to fully encase the
meat. Place pork on the center of leaves, fat side down, and
wrap the meat with the seams coming together at the top.
Once wrapped, pick up and invert the entire package, seam
side down, into a Dutch oven. Any extra banana leaves can be
tucked in around the sides. Bake, covered, in the preheated
oven for about 4 hours, or an instant-read thermometer
inserted near the center reads 195 to 200 degrees F (91 to
93 degrees C). Let pork rest in the Dutch oven for 30 to 60
minutes, then remove the meat to a bowl. Pull meat off the
bone, and set bone aside. Add any and all cooking liquids
and rendered fat into the bowl of pork. Use two forks to
shred meat as finely as you like. Taste for seasoning;
adjust with more salt or liquid smoke to taste. Arrange
banana leaves in the pot to make a nest for the meat.
Transfer shredded pork in and serve immediately.
