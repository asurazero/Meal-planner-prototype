Chicken Meatballs


Ingredients
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
1/3 cup panko
1/3 cup whole milk
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons italian seasoning
1 1/2 teaspoons orcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 pound ground chicken breast
1 large egg, lightly beaten

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C) with a rack in the top third position. Line
a large-rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, and
lightly grease with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Stir together
breadcrumbs and milk in a bowl until fully combined. Let
stand at room temperature until milk is fully absorbed into
breadcrumbs, about 10 minutes. Add Parmesan, Italian
seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, salt, onion powder,
granulated garlic, and pepper to the breadcrumb mixture, and
stir to combine. Mix together chicken, egg, and 2
tablespoons of the oil in a large bowl until combined. Fold
breadcrumb mixture into chicken mixture until just combined.
Place chicken mixture in refrigerator, uncovered, and chill
until firm, about 10 minutes. Gently shape chicken mixture
into 20 (1 1/2-inch balls), and place on the prepared baking
sheet leaving a 1-inch space between each meatball. Brush
tops and sides of meatballs with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and an instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball registers
165 degrees F (73 degrees C), 15 to 20 minutes, flipping
after 8 minutes.
