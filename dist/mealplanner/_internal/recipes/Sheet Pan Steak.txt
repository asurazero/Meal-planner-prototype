Sheet Pan Steak


Ingredients
1 pound round steak
1 (1.06 ounce) marinade
1/4 cup oil
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
3 cups baby potatoes, halved
1 pound green beans, trimmed
1 (1.25 ounce) package oasted onion & garlic potato seasoning,
2 tablespoons oil

Cooking Instructions

Place steak in a resealable plastic bag. Whisk together
marinade mix, 1/4 cup oil, water, and red wine vinegar in a
small bowl; pour into the bag. Reseal the bag, pressing out
excess air, and squeeze bag to coat steak. Marinate steak in
the refrigerator for a minimum of 30 minutes or up to
overnight. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees
C). Line a baking sheet with foil. Place baby potatoes,
green beans, and 2 tablespoons oil in a large resealable
plastic bag; toss well to coat. Sprinkle in potato
seasoning, reseal the bag, and toss again. Spread vegetables
in a single layer on the prepared sheet; add steak on top of
vegetables. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are
tender and steaks are firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the
center, about 1 hour. Turn on the broiler, and broil steak
for 3 minutes. Turn steak over and broil 3 minutes more. An
instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Serve
immediately.
