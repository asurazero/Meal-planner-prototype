Waffle House-Style Waffles


Ingredients
1 ½ cups flour
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
1 large egg
¼ cup sugar
¼ cup salted butter, softened, plus more for serving
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup half-and-half
½ cup buttermilk
cooking spray
pure maple syrup, and/or chocolate chips, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Whisk together flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, and
baking soda in a bowl. Whisk together egg, sugar, butter,
and vanilla in a separate large bowl until mixture is
smooth. Whisk in half-and-half and buttermilk. Add flour
mixture; stir until just combined and a few lumps remain.
(Do not overmix.) Chill, covered, at least 1 hour or up to
overnight. Preheat waffle iron to medium-high; lightly coat
with cooking spray. Pour about 2/3 cup batter onto waffle
iron. Cook until golden and crisp on edges, 4 to 6 minutes.
Transfer to a plate; keep warm. Repeat with remaining
batter. Serve waffles with maple syrup, chocolate chips,
and/or additional butter.
