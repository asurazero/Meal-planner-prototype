Chili-Bacon Cinnamon Rolls


Ingredients
1 17.5-ounce) package cinnamon rolls with icing
1 teaspoon chili powder
10 slices bacon

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
9-inch round cake pan. Unroll cinnamon roll dough. Sprinkle
evenly with chili powder, then separate along perforations
into 5 portions. Cook bacon in a very large skillet until
just starting to crisp, about 7 minutes. While bacon is
still warm, lay 2 slices on each dough portion; roll up.
Arrange in the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven
until browned and tops appear dry, about 25 minutes. Frost
with icing. Add desired toppers (if using). Serve warm.
