Cornmeal-Crusted Cod


Ingredients
12 cod filets
1/4 cup lime juice
2/3 cup cornmeal
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup butter

Cooking Instructions

Rinse cod filets with water. Pat fish dry. Place lime juice
in a shallow bowl. Whisk cornmeal, flour, salt, and pepper
together in a separate shallow bowl. Heat oil and butter in
a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Using tongs, dip
cod into lime juice; allow excess to drip off. Press fish
into cornmeal mixture to coat on all sides; set aside on a
plate. Fry cod in the hot skillet until crispy golden brown,
2 to 3 minutes. Turn and fry until fish flakes easily with a
fork and is golden brown on the other side; about 1 minute
more. Cooking time will depend on thickness of filets. You
may have to fry in batches. Remove fish to a wire rack set
over a drip tray to catch any excess oil. Serve immediately.
