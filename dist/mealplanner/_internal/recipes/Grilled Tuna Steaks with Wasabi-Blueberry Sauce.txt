Grilled Tuna Steaks with Wasabi-Blueberry Sauce


Ingredients
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 shallot, minced
1 (6 ounce) package fresh blueberries
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon wasabi paste
1 1/2 pound sushi-grade tuna steaks
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon furikake seasoning, or more as needed
cooked rice, for serving
fresh cilantro, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

For sauce, heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.
Add shallot; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3
to 5 minutes. Add blueberries, honey, soy sauce, and
vinegar. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered,
until most of blueberries have burst, about 5 minutes.
Transfer to a medium bowl. Set bowl in a larger bowl filled
with ice water. Let cool completely, about 20 minutes. Stir
in wasabi paste. Preheat grill to medium-high heat (375 to
400 degrees F (190 to 200 degrees C)). Pat tuna steaks dry
with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper. Spread
furikake seasoning on a small plate. Roll edges of tuna
steaks in furikake to coat. Oil grill grates. Grill tuna,
covered, turning halfway through, about 4 minutes. (Tuna
should be pink in center.) Transfer tuna to a cutting board;
tent with foil and let stand 5 minutes. Thinly slice tuna
steaks and serve over rice with sauce. Garnish with
cilantro.
