Cooking Instructions

Toss pork meat with taco seasoning mix in a plastic
resealable bag until coated. Heat oil in a skillet over
medium-high heat. Fry seasoned pork in hot oil, stirring
occasionally, until pork is no longer pink. Stir salsa,
beans, and apricot preserves into the skillet with pork.
Reduce heat to low; simmer until heated through, about 10
minutes. Spoon 1/3 cup pork mixture into each taco shell and
top with sliced olives.
