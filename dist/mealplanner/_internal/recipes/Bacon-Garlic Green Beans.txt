Bacon-Garlic Green Beans


Ingredients
3 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed
4 slices bacon
1 cup butter
4 cloves garlic, minced
Â½ teaspoon lemon zest

Cooking Instructions

Place green beans in a pot and cover with water; bring to a
boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beans start
to soften, about 10 minutes. Drain water, leaving beans in
the pot. Place bacon strips on a microwave-safe plate and
cook in the microwave until crisp, about 2 minutes. Cool and
crumble bacon. Stir butter and bacon into beans in the pot
and return to medium heat; cook and stir until butter melts,
2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 3
to 4 minutes. Top with lemon zest and stir.
