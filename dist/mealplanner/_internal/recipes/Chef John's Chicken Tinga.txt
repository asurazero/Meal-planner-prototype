Ingredients
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
4 cups chicken stock
1 cup water
1 large yellow onion, halved
3 peeled whole garlic cloves
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
Â½ teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, diced
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
1 (28 ounce) can peeled plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste
2 tablespoons crumbled cotija cheese, or to taste

Cooking Instructions

Place chicken thighs, chicken stock, water, halved onion,
garlic cloves, salt, and oregano in a large pot. Bring to a
simmer over high heat; reduce to medium-low and cook,
stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Remove from heat.
Transfer onion halves to a bowl with a slotted spoon;
transfer chicken thighs to a separate bowl. Pour broth
through a strainer into a large bowl. Heat olive oil in the
same pot over medium heat. Add diced onions and cook until
beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Transfer strained
liquid to onions. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat;
turn heat to medium-low; reduce broth by about half, 15 to
20 minutes. Transfer reserved boiled onions to a blender.
Add chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Swirl a bit of water in
the can and add to the blender. Add tomatoes. Cover blender
with the lid; pulse on and off until mixture is partially
blended, then blend on medium speed until smooth, 1 or 2
minutes. Transfer to pot with broth and onions. Increase
heat to medium-high. Simmer 15 minutes or so, depending on
how thick you want the sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low.
Tear chicken into bite-size pieces and add to the pot. Cook
another 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish;
garnish with cilantro and crumbled cotija cheese.
