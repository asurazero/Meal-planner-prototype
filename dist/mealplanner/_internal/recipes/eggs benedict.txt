Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Prepare Hollandaise: Whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice,
and pepper in a pan over low heat. Add 1/2 of the butter and
continue to whisk until the butter is melted and
incorporated. Add remaining butter and salt and whisk until
melted. Sprinkle in paprika. Turn heat off and cover with a
lid to keep warm. Fill a large saucepan with 5 to 8 inches
of water and bring to a gentle simmer. Add vinegar and
reduce heat to low. Carefully break eggs into the simmering
water and cook until whites are firm and the yolks have
thickened but are not hard, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the eggs
from the water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel
to remove excess water, and place onto a warm plate. While
the eggs are poaching heat ham in a skillet over medium-high
heat until warm, 2 to 3 minutes, microwave spinach sprinkled
with a little water on a plate for 30 seconds, and toast
English muffins. Spread butter on toasted muffins. Top each
half with a slice of ham, some spinach, and a poached egg.
Drizzle with a healthy helping of Hollandaise and serve
immediately.
