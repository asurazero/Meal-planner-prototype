french toast


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray; add bread
cubes. In a large bowl, beat cream cheese with an electric
mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time,
mixing well after each addition. Stir in milk, half-and-
half, maple syrup, and vanilla until mixture is smooth; pour
over bread cubes. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to
overnight. The next morning, remove souffl√© from the
refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 30
minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190
degrees C). Bake souffl√©, uncovered, in the preheated oven
until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about
30 minutes. Serve warm, sprinkled with confectioners' sugar.
