Chicken Fajita Tacos


Ingredients
1/4 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons taco seasoning (see Note)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips
1/2 onion, cut into strips
1/2 green bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips
1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips
8 6 inch flour tortillas
1 avocado, pitted and sliced, or as needed
1/2 cup sour cream, or as needed
1/2 cup cotija cheese, or as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine orange juice, taco seasoning, and vegetable oil in a
large resealable bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade,
squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the
refrigerator overnight. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium
high heat. Cook chicken in the hot skillet for 5 minutes.
Add onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper. Cook
until peppers are crisp tender, 4 to 5 minutes. An instant-
read thermometer inserted into center of chicken strips
should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Heat tortillas
until soft and pliable. Top with chicken fajita mixture,
avocado, sour cream, and cotija cheese. Serve immediately.
