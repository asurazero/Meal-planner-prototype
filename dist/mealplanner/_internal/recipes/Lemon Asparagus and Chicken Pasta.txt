Lemon Asparagus and Chicken Pasta


Ingredients
½ (16 ounce) package spaghetti
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
4 (5-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
¼ cup basil pesto, or to taste
1 bunch asparagus, cut into 2-inch pieces
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
½ lemon, juiced
1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until
tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain,
reserving some pasta water. While pasta is cooking, heat 1
tablespoon oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
Add chicken and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Flip,
add a dollop of pesto to each chicken breast, and continue
to cook, flipping as needed, until no longer pink in the
centers, 7 to 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
(74 degrees C). Heat remaining oil in a separate pan over
medium heat. Add asparagus and cook for 1 to 3 minutes,
depending how tender you like it. Add garlic, pepper flakes,
and lemon juice; cook for 1 minute. Add cooked pasta, a
dollop of pesto, and Parmesan cheese; stir until cheese
melts. Add a tablespoon of the reserved pasta water if
cheese begins to stick to the pan. Chop chicken and add on
top of spaghetti. Season with salt and pepper.
