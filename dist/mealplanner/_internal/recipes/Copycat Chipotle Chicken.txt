Copycat Chipotle Chicken


Ingredients
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
3 cloves garlic
2 chipotle peppers
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon honey

Cooking Instructions

Combine chicken, garlic, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, 3
tablespoons olive oil, cumin, white vinegar, salt, pepper,
and honey in a large resealable bag. Seal bag and toss to
coat thoroughly. Refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to
overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
C). Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.
Add a little oil if necessary. Add chicken in one layer to
skillet and cook, undisturbed, until chicken is deep golden
brown and releases easily from the skillet, 5 to 7 minutes.
Flip chicken and transfer to the preheated oven until
chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run
clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74
degrees C). Let chicken rest 10 minutes before cutting.
