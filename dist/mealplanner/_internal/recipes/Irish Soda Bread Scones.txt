Irish Soda Bread Scones


Ingredients
1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
1 cup rolled oats
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon baking soda
5 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided
½ cup unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces
½ cup raisins or dried currants
½ teaspoon orange zest
¾ cup whole buttermilk, divided

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Whisk together flour, oats, baking
powder, salt, baking soda, and 1/4 cup sugar in a large bowl
until combined. Cut butter into flour mixture with your
fingers or a pastry cutter until dough resembles coarse
meal. Add raisins, orange zest, and 3/4 cup plus 1
tablespoon buttermilk; stir until just combined. Transfer
dough to a lightly floured work surface; pat dough into a
7-inch circle, about 3/4-inch thick. Line a baking sheet
with parchment. Using a floured bench scraper or knife, cut
dough circle into 8 wedges; place wedges on the prepared
baking sheet, spacing about 1 inch apart. Alternatively,
scoop 8 (1/3-cup) mounds of dough onto a parchment-lined
baking sheet, about 2 inches apart. Brush each scone evenly
with remaining 2 tablespoons buttermilk, and sprinkle with
remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Place baking sheet in freezer,
and freeze until chilled, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven
to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bake scones in the
preheated oven until bottoms and tops are golden, about 20
minutes. Remove from the oven, and let cool completely on
the baking sheet, about 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room
temperature with butter and jam, if desired.
