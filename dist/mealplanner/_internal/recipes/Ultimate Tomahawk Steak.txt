Ultimate Tomahawk Steak


Ingredients
3 1/2 pound tomahawk rib eye steak
1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
2 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper

Cooking Instructions

Remove steak from refrigerator and let stand at room
temperature 30 minutes to an hour before cooking. Preheat
the grill to medium-high, 400 to 450 degrees F (200 to 230
degrees C). Sprinkle steak evenly and liberally on all sides
with salt and black pepper. Lightly coat grill grates with
oil or grilling spray. Place steak on hot grates, and grill,
undisturbed, until it releases easily from the grates, about
4 minutes. Flip, and repeat on the other side. Continue
grilling, turning occasionally, until a thermometer inserted
into the thickest portion of steak registers 125 degrees F
(52 degrees C), 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer steak to a
cutting board; let rest 15 minutes. Run a knife along the
inside edge of the bone to remove steak from the bone in 1
piece; slice against the grain to serve.
