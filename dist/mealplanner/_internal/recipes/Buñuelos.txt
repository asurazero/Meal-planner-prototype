Ingredients
4 large eggs
Â¼ cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 Â½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup vegetable oil for frying

Cooking Instructions

Beat eggs and 1/4 cup sugar in a large bowl until thick and
lemon-colored; mix in 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Combine 1 Â½
cups of flour, baking powder, and salt; gradually add to egg
mixture, mixing well until evenly combined. Turn dough out
onto a floured board and knead thoroughly until dough is
smooth. Shape dough into 16 even-sized balls. Flatten and
roll each one into a very thin circle about 5 inches in
diameter. Let stand uncovered on waxed paper for about 10
minutes. Meanwhile, combine 1 cup sugar and cinnamon in a
small bowl until evenly mixed; set aside. Heat oil in a deep
pan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lower one circle of
dough carefully into the hot oil; fry until golden, turning
once, about 30 seconds on each side. Transfer to a paper
towel-lined plate to drain; sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar
mixture. Repeat with remaining dough. Serve or cool and
store in airtight containers.
