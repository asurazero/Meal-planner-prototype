Lacinato Kale Salad with Warm Bacon Vinaigrette


Ingredients
2 bunches lacinato kale
1/3 cup red onion (see Note)
1/2 cup dried apricots
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/2 red bell pepper
3 slices bacon
1 clove garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil (see Note)
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Cooking Instructions

Wash kale in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Using
a sharp knife, remove stems and coarse veins, and chop kale
into bite-sized pieces. Place chopped kale and red onion
slices in a large salad bowl, and set aside. For dressing,
cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until browned and
crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove bacon from the skillet, chop,
and reserve. To the bacon drippings in the same skillet, add
only enough olive oil to equal 1/4 cup. Heat the combined
drippings and the olive over medium heat until hot. Stir in
the minced garlic and cook about 30 seconds. Remove the
skillet from the heat and stir in balsamic vinegar, Dijon
mustard, salt and pepper to taste, and red pepper flakes, to
taste. Pour mixture over torn kale and onion slices, and
stir until well coated with the hot dressing. Add chopped
apricots, blanched slivered almonds, and red bell pepper
strips. Give the salad a final toss, and garnish with
reserved chopped bacon.
