Trout Meunière


Ingredients
4 (6 ounce) fillets boneless, skin-on rainbow trout fillets, patted dry
Â¾ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
Â½ teaspoon finely ground black pepper
Â½ cup all-purpose flour
4 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
lemon wedges, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (93 degrees C). Line a
rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
Season trout fillets evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt and
pepper. Lightly dredge each fillet in flour, shaking off
excess flour. Heat ghee over medium-high in a large skillet.
When butter shimmers, add fish fillets skin-side down,
cooking in batches if necessary. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes,
flip, and continue cooking until the outside is lightly
golden brown, and fish is just cooked through and opaque, 1
to 2 minutes. Remove cooked fish to the prepared baking
sheet and place in the preheated oven to keep warm. Pour
excess ghee or clarified butter from skillet; wipe skillet
clean. Add unsalted butter and shallot to the skillet and
cook briefly over medium heat until butter is melted and
shallot has softened a bit, about 1 minute. Stir in lemon
juice and season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Allow
mixture to cook for about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, and
stir in parsley. Place fish fillets on plates or a platter;
top with sauce from skillet and serve immediately with lemon
wedges on the side.
