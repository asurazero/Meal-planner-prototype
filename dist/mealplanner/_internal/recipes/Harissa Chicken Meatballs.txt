Ingredients
1 pound ground chicken
1/3 cup breadcrumbs
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons harissa paste
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons fresh mint (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine ground chicken,
breadcrumbs, egg, harissa, garlic powder, salt, cumin,
paprika, and black pepper in a large bowl. Mix gently with a
fork or damp hands just until thoroughly combined. Shape the

Sprinkle with mint. Serve hot with your favorite side dish
or dipping sauce.
