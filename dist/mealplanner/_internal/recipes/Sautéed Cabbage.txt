Sautéed Cabbage


Ingredients
1 small head green cabbage (about 2 pounds)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 cup onion
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt,
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper,
4 lemon wedges

Cooking Instructions

Remove any damaged outer leaves from cabbage. Cut cabbage in
half down through the stem, then cut halves into quarters.
Carefully cut out cores and thinly slice cabbage. Heat a
large skillet over medium heat, and add olive oil and
butter. Once melted, add onions, and saute until translucent
and just lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes Add garlic, and
cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cabbage, mixing
well with onions, and cook, stirring frequently, until
tender and lightly browned, but not burned, 13 to 16
minutes. If cabbage starts to dry out a bit, add a little
water to the pan. Drizzle vinegar over cabbage, stir well,
and cook for 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper,
and serve hot with a wedge of fresh lemon.
