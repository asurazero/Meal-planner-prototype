Beet Salad with Goat Cheese


Ingredients
4 medium beets - scrubbed, trimmed, and cut in half
1/3 cup chopped walnuts
3 tablespoons maple syrup
1 (10 ounce) package mixed baby salad greens
1/2 cup frozen orange juice concentrate
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 ounces goat cheese

Cooking Instructions

Place beets into a saucepan; add enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil, then cook for 20 to 30 minutes, until
tender. Drain and cool, then cut into cubes. While beets are
cooking, place walnuts in a skillet over medium-low heat.
Heat until warm and starting to toast. Stir in maple syrup;
cook and stir until evenly coated, then remove from heat and
set aside to cool. To make the dressing: Whisk orange juice
concentrate, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil together in a
small bowl. Place a large helping of baby greens onto each
of four salad plates, divide candied walnuts equally and
sprinkle over greens. Place equal amounts of beets over
greens and top with pieces of goat cheese. Drizzle dressing
over each salad.
