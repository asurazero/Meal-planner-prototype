Â½ onion, chopped
1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
2 teaspoons minced garlic, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup baby spinach
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed
2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 (1 1/2-pound) boned, skinned salmon fillet
Â½ teaspoon smoked paprika, or more to taste
1 egg, beaten
Â½ cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
Â½ teaspoon dried dill

Cooking Instructions

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add mushrooms and 1 teaspoon garlic; cook and stir until
mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and
black pepper. Transfer onion and mushroom mixture to a small
bowl. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet.
Add remaining 1 teaspoon garlic; cook and stir until
fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add spinach; cook and stir until
wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
Transfer to another bowl. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Line a glass baking dish with parchment paper.
Dust work surface with flour. Lay 1 puff pastry sheet out on
work surface; spread onion and mushroom mixture evenly
across pastry, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Center salmon on
top; sprinkle paprika over salmon and top with wilted
spinach. Cover with second puff pastry sheet. Fold over and
crimp edges to seal. Brush top with beaten egg. Transfer to
prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until
pastry is golden, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool briefly, then
slice into 4 portions. To make the sauce: Whisk mayonnaise,
lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and dill together in a small
bowl. Spoon sauce onto 4 plates and place a piece of salmon
en croÃ»te on each.
