Grilled Chicken Street Tacos


Ingredients
1 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
24 corn tortillas (such as
1/3 cup white onion
1/3 cup cilantro
Mexican hot sauce (such as
4 lime wedges

Cooking Instructions

In a gallon-size resealable bag, place chicken, lime juice,
vegetable oil, garlic, cumin, coriander and chili powder.
Reseal the bag, and massage bag until chicken is evenly
coated. Marinate for 1 to 2 hours in the refrigerator.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the
grate. Remove chicken from marinade and place on the hot
grill. Discard marinade. Grill over direct heat until juices
run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant read
thermometer inserted near the center should read at least
165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove to a plate and let rest
for 5 minutes. Chop chicken into small pieces and set aside,
keeping it warm. Place tortillas on the hot grill, stacked 2
tortillas thick, and heat for about 20 to 30 seconds; flip
each stack and heat an additional 20 to 30 seconds. Divide
the chicken mixture between the 12 stacks of tortillas. Top
with onion and cilantro and drizzle with hot sauce, if
desired. Serve with lime wedges.
