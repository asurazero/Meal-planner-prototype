smoked brisket


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Place the beef brisket in a large slow cooker with the fat
side up. Pour the coffee over the meat. Cook the brisket on
LOW for 24 hours. Meanwhile, stir together the ketchup, cola
beverage, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, liquid smoke, and
brown sugar in a bowl until well blended. Refrigerate until
needed. After 24 hours, remove and discard any fat from the
brisket. Use a fork to pull apart and shred the meat. Pour
the sauce over the meat, stirring to coat evenly, and cook 1
hour longer.
