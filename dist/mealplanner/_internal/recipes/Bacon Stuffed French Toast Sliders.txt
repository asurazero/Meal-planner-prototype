Bacon Stuffed French Toast Sliders


Ingredients
1 pound bacon
1 (12 count) package Hawaiian rolls
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
2 large eggs
1/3 cup half-and-half
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon maple syrup
confectioner's sugar, for serving (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with aluminum foil, and lay bacon strips in a
single layer on the sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until
browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. Drain bacon slices on
paper towels. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F
(160 degrees C). Slice rolls in half lengthwise. Spread 2
tablespoons butter over the cut side of bottom half of
rolls. Top evenly with brown sugar and cayenne pepper.
Arrange bacon slices over brown sugar mixture. Spread 1
tablespoon butter evenly into the bottom of a 9x13-inch
casserole dish. Place the prepared sandwich half in the
buttered pan. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, vanilla, salt, and
syrup together in a separate 9x13-inch baking dish. Add top
half of rolls to egg mixture and turn a couple times to coat
and lightly soak the bread. Allow the excess egg mixture to
drip off and place top half of rolls over bacon layer. Cover
with foil. Discard any excess egg mixture. Bake in the
preheated oven for 15 minutes. Uncover and bake until golden
brown and lightly toasted, 5 to 10 minutes more. Spread
remaining butter over the tops. Cut into 12 servings. Dust
with confectioner's sugar. Serve with syrup for dipping.
