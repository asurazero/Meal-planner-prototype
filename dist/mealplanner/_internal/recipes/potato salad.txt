potato salad


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water;
bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until
tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool. While
the potatoes are cooking, whisk together sugar, 2 beaten
eggs, and cornstarch in a saucepan; season with salt. Stir
in milk, vinegar, and mustard. Cook and stir over medium
heat until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and
stir in butter. Refrigerate until cool, then stir in
mayonnaise. Peel and dice potatoes. Transfer to a large
bowl; toss with hard-cooked eggs, onion, celery, and 1
teaspoon salt. Stir dressing gently into the bowl of potato
salad until evenly coated. Chill before serving, 3 hours to
overnight.
