Cold Green Bean Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette


Ingredients
ice as needed
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
zest of 1/2 lemon
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch sugar, or more to taste
2 ounces soft goat cheese, crumbled
¼ cup toasted sliced almonds

Cooking Instructions

Make an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice water, and
set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add
green beans, and blanch until just tender-crisp, 3 to 4
minutes (do not overcook). Drain green beans, and
immediately add to ice bath to stop cooking; set aside.
Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon, lemon zest, salt,
pepper, and a pinch of sugar together in a small bowl. Drain
green beans well and pat dry with a paper towel to avoid
diluting the dressing. Place into a bowl and drizzle with
vinaigrette, tossing gently to coat. Transfer tossed green
beans to a serving dish. Garnish with goat cheese and
almonds.
