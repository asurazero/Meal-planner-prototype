Chocolate Chip Pancakes


Ingredients
¾ cup milk
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
¼ teaspoon salt
1 large egg
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
½ cup mini chocolate chips, or more to taste
cooking spray

Cooking Instructions

To make the buttermilk: Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl
and set aside for 5 minutes to sour the milk. Combine flour,
sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large
mixing bowl. Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into
buttermilk mixture until well combined; add flour mixture
and whisk until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. The
pancake batter will be thick. Allow batter to rest for 5
minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat
with cooking spray. Pour about ¼ cup of batter for each
pancake onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles appear on the
surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancake with a spatula, and
cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes.
Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately.
