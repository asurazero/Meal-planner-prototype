Asparagus Salad


Ingredients
Â¼ cup olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
12 fresh asparagus spears
6 cups fresh spinach leaves
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon seasoned slivered almonds

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat and lightly oil the
grate. Combine oil and lemon juice in a baking dish. Add
asparagus and roll until coated. Grill asparagus on the
preheated grill, turning at least once and brushing with
remaining oil-lemon juice mixture, until crisp-tender, about
5 minutes. Remove from the grill and place back into the
baking dish. Cut into bite-sized pieces. Combine spinach,
Parmesan, and almonds in a large bowl. Add asparagus along
with any oil-lemon juice mixture from the dish. Toss to
blend and serve immediately.
