Tilapia with Lemon-Boursin Cream Sauce


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1 pound tilapia filets
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon italian seasoning
1 tablespoon butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup vegetable broth
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 ounce Garlic & Fine Herbs Cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 lemon, sliced, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Heat olive oil with 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over
medium heat until butter is melted. Season fish on both
sides with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Add fish to
the skillet and cook until a golden crust appears, about 3
minutes per side. Remove fish from the skillet and set
aside; keep warm. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the
same skillet over medium-high heat; add garlic and cook
until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in vegetable broth;
cook for 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and slowly
whisk in heavy cream and Boursin cheese. Add lemon juice and
whisk constantly until the sauce is well combined and
smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place fish on
serving plates, and pour the sauce over. Garnish with fresh
lemon slices.
