Lemon Coconut Cake


Ingredients
6 large egg yolks,
2/3 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons lemon zest
3/4 cup lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes
3 cups cake flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup sour cream,
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup coconut milk
6 large egg whites,
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
4 cups confectioner's sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon coconut milk
1 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes

Cooking Instructions

For lemon curd, add egg yolks, sugar, lemon zest, lemon
juice, salt, and butter to a small non-reactive saucepan
over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until
mixture begins to simmer and has thickened, 8 to 12 minutes.
Pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl,
using a spatula or wooden spoon to push the mixture through.
Cover with a piece of plastic wrap directly touching the top
of the curd, and refrigerate until chilled. For cakes,
preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease 3 8-inch round cake pans, and line the bottoms with
parchment paper. Place coconut flakes into a food processor
or blender, and pulse a few times until coconut flakes are
finely chopped. Set aside. Sift cake flour, baking powder,
salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. In a separate
large bowl, beat butter, vegetable oil, and sugar together
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 4
minutes. Add in sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and mix
until thoroughly combined. Add in 1/2 of flour mixture and
mix until just combined. Add in coconut milk and mix until
just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until
just combined. In a separate clean bowl, combine egg whites
and cream of tartar. With clean beaters, beat egg whites on
medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.
Add 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the batter, and fold
just until no streaks of whites remain. Add in remaining egg
white mixture and gently fold until no streaks of white
remain. Divide batter evenly between the 3 prepared cake
pans. Bake in the preheated oven until tops of cakes spring
back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cakes to
cool in pans for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack
to cool completely. For frosting, cut cold butter into
1/2-inch pieces. Place into a bowl. Starting on low speed,
beat butter with an electric mixer until just loosened.
Gradually increase the mixer speed, and beat butter until
smooth, about 2 minutes. Add in cold cream cheese, and beat
on medium-high speed until completely smooth and combined,
about 3 minutes. Add in confectioner’s sugar; beat until
thoroughly combined. Add in lemon zest, vanilla, and salt
and mix until combined. Add in remaining confectioner’s
sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add in 1 tablespoon cold coconut milk and beat mixture on
medium-high speed for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. If
frosting is a bit too soft to spread onto the cake layers,
place it into the fridge for about 10 minutes, or until it
is easier to use. To assemble the cake, place one cake layer
onto a cake plate or serving platter. Spread a thin layer of
cream cheese frosting over the top of the cake. Pipe a ring
of frosting around the top edge of the cake. Place about 2
tablespoons of lemon curd in the center of the frosting
ring, and smooth into an even layer. Stack another cake
layer on top of the first, and repeat the process of
frosting and filling. When the last cake layer is stacked on
top, frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer
of frosting. Use your hands to press the toasted coconut
flakes onto the sides of the cake. If desired, drizzle or
swirl the top of cake with some of the extra lemon curd.
Place cake into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes
before serving.
