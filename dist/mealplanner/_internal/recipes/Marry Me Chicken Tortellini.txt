Marry Me Chicken Tortellini


Ingredients
4 thick-cut bacon
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
3/4 cup sundried tomatoes in oil
1/2 cup shallot
4 large garlic cloves
1 1/2 teaspoons talian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 package refrigerated cheese tortellini
1/2 cup pre-grated Parmesan cheese
torn fresh basil leaves

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Fill a large saucepan with salted
water and bring to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, heat a
large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped bacon; cook,
stirring occasionally, until rendered and crispy, about 8
minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper
towel-lined plate to drain, reserving about 3 tablespoons
drippings in skillet. While bacon cooks, sprinkle chicken
evenly with pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Add chicken
to skillet with drippings; cook over medium-high, until
chicken is browned and cooked through (a thermometer
inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 165
degrees F (73 degrees C)), 5 to 6 minutes per side, reducing
heat if bottom of pan gets too dark. Transfer chicken to a
plate; set aside until cool enough to handle, about 10
minutes. Chop chicken into bite-size pieces. Reduce heat to
medium, and add sundried tomatoes and shallot. Cook,
stirring often, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic,
Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, and remaining 1
teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant,
about 30 seconds. Add tomato paste; cook, stirring
constantly, until deepened in color, about 1 minute. Pour in
chicken broth; cook, stirring and scraping constantly to
deglaze the skillet, about 1 minute. Stir in cream and bring
to a simmer over medium. Simmer, stirring occasionally,
until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tortellini to
boiling water, and boil until tortellini are tender and
float to the surface, 3 to 5 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking
water. Drain. Stir Parmesan cheese, reserved cooked bacon,
reserved chopped chicken, and tortellini into skillet with
cream mixture. Cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until
evenly coated in sauce. Add reserved cooking water, 1/4 cup
at a time, if necessary to maintain a creamy consistency.
Divide mixture among 6 bowls; garnish with additional
Parmesan cheese and a generous scattering of fresh basil.
