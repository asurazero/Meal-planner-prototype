Strawberry Tres Leches Cake


Ingredients
baking spray
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3 large eggs, at room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup whole milk, at room temperature
1 strawberries, hulled and quartered, plus sliced strawberries for garnish
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
whipped topping to taste

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Lightly spray a 13- x 9-inch baking dish
with baking spray; set aside. Whisk together flour, baking
powder, and salt in a bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer
fitted with a paddle attachment, beat eggs, sugar, and
vanilla on medium speed until light, fluffy, and almost
doubled in volume, about 10 minutes. Beat in half of the
flour mixture on low speed until just incorporated.
Gradually stream in the milk until combined, followed by the
remaining flour mixture. Transfer batter to prepared baking
dish. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown and a wooden
skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean,
25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool on a
wire rack in the pan for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, for the
strawberry milk toss strawberries and sugar in a small bowl
until fully coated, let rest at room temperature for 10
minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer to a blender and
process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Strain puree through
a fine mesh sieve into a large bowl, discarding any pulp or
seeds. Whisk together 1 cup of the strained strawberry puree
(reserving any remaining for a later use), evaporated milk,
condensed milk, and heavy cream into a large bowl until
fully combined. Using a wooden skewer or the tines of a
fork, poke holes all over the top of the cooled Cake, pour
strawberry ,ilk mixture evenly over cake. Cover with plastic
wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 12 hours.
Top with a layer of whipped topping and sliced strawberries
before serving.
