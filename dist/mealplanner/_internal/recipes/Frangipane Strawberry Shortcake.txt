Frangipane Strawberry Shortcake


Ingredients
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 large egg, at room temperature
2 tablespoons milk
1/3 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup almond flour
1/4 cup sliced almonds
2 pounds strawberries
2/3 cup sugar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease
four 5.5-ounce ramekins with butter, and line bottoms with a
round piece of parchment paper. Alternatively, line 6 wells
of a standard muffin tin with parchment paper cups. Beat
butter and sugar together with an electric mixer until light
and fluffy. Add egg, milk, flour, baking powder, salt,
vanilla, and almond extract, and mix again until light and
fluffy. Add almond flour and mix until incorporated.
Transfer batter evenly into ramekins, and top with sliced
almonds. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick
inserted near the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
If using a muffin tin, check after 25 minutes. Let cool for
20 minutes; remove from the ramekins. Let cool completely
before using. Trim strawberries, cut into 1/8-inch slices,
and add to a bowl. Add sugar and toss with a spoon until
sugar disappears. Cover and let stand 20 minutes. Uncover,
toss berries; cover again and let stand 20 minutes more,
then refrigerate until strawberries have produced as much
syrup as you like. To serve, cut shortcakes in half, and
place bottom half in a bowl. Spoon strawberries and syrup
generously over, then place top half of shortcake on top.
Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
