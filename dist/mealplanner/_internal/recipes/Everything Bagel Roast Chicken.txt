Everything Bagel Roast Chicken


Ingredients
4 leg quarters, with skin whole
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
Everything Bagel Seasoning (such as Trader Joe's
6 garlic cloves
1/2 can or bottle lager beer
2 tablespoons Maggi
1/2 stick butter

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Start by
trimming any excess fat from the leg quarters. Pat leg
quarters dry and brush all over with about half of the olive
oil. Sprinkle both sides generously with Everything Bagel
Seasoning Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in an oven-
safe skillet over medium heat and brown chicken skin-side
down until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken over
and brown the other side for 2 minutes more. Turn off the
heat and carefully pour beer around the chicken legs on the
sides of the skillet, being careful not to pour any over the
crispy skin directly. Add loosely crushed garlic cloves and
drizzle seasoning sauce into the pan. Place knobs of butter
onto the chicken and transfer skillet to the oven. Roast in
the preheated oven until chicken is deeply browned, 40 to 45
minutes. Serve with pan juices drizzled over chicken.
