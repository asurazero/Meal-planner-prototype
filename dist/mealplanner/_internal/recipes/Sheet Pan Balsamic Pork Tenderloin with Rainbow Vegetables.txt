Sheet Pan Balsamic Pork Tenderloin with Rainbow Vegetables


Ingredients
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 dates, pitted and chopped, or to taste
3 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon sliced garlic
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
6 cups 1/2-inch x 2-inch rainbow carrot sticks
4 cups 1/2-inch x 2-inch peeled, seeded butternut squash chunks
½ red onion, sliced lengthwise
2 (1 1/4 pound) pork tenderloins

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
sheet pan with parchment paper or foil. Place 2 tablespoons
olive oil, dates, vinegar, rosemary, garlic, salt, and
pepper in a blender or small food processor. Pulse several
times to mix, then puree until smooth, about 1 minute.
Reserve 2 tablespoons of the mixture for later use. Combine
rainbow carrots, butternut squash, and red onion in a large
bowl. Toss with balsamic mixture, and place on the prepared
sheet pan. Roast vegetables, uncovered in the preheated oven
for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, blot tenderloins with paper
towels. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over
medium-high heat. Place tenderloins in skillet and cook
until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Stir
vegetables; nestle tenderloins into vegetables. Brush each
tenderloin with 1 tablespoon reserved balsamic mixture and
return the sheet pan to the oven. Roast, uncovered, until
vegetables are tender and pork is slightly pink in the
center, about 20 minutes. The internal temperature of the
meat should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Drizzle vegetables and tenderloins with remaining 1
tablespoon olive oil.
