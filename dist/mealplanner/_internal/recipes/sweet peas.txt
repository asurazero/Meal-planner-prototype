Cooking Instructions

Gather the ingredients. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165
degrees C). Prepare sweet potatoes: Put sweet potatoes in a
medium saucepan and cover with water. Cook over medium-high
heat until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a
large bowl. Mash drained sweet potatoes with a fork. Add
eggs; mix until well combined. Add sugar, milk, butter,
vanilla, and salt; mix until smooth. Transfer to a 9x13-inch
baking dish. Make topping: Mix brown sugar and flour
together in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry
cutter until mixture is coarse and looks like peas; don't
overmix. Stir in pecans. Sprinkle topping over sweet potato
mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly
browned, about 30 minutes. Serve and enjoy!
