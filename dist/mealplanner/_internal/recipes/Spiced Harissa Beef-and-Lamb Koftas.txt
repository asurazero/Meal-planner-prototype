Spiced Harissa Beef-and-Lamb Koftas


Ingredients
1 pound 85% lean ground beef chuck
8 ounces ground lamb
1 large egg
1/3 cup fresh cilantro
1/4 cup onion
2 tablespoons harissa paste (see Note)
2 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1 1/2 tablespoons tahini
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh parsley
1/8 teaspoon salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat (350 to 375 degrees
F (175 to 190 degrees C)). Combine beef, lamb, egg,
cilantro, onion, harissa, garlic, coriander, 1 teaspoon
salt, the cumin, turmeric, ginger, and cinnamon in a large
bowl. Be careful not to overmix, or meat will be tough.
Shape mixture around 6 (10-inch) skewers, making the meat
mixture 1-inch thick around the skewers. Oil grill grates.
Grill koftas, covered, turning occasionally, until an
instant-read thermometer inserted into centers registers 160
degrees F (71 degrees C), about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, stir
yogurt, tahini, lemon juice, parsley, and 1/8 teaspoon salt
together in a small bowl. Serve yogurt sauce with koftas.
