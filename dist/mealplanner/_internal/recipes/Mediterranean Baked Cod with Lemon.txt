Mediterranean Baked Cod with Lemon


Ingredients
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1 tablespoon garlic
1 tablespoon fresh parsley
2 teaspoons fresh oregano
1 teaspoon rosemary
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
4 (6 ounce) cod filets
2 lemons, each cut into 8 thin slices
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 sprigs fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place
softened butter, minced garlic, parsley, oregano, and thyme
or rosemary on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, cut
herbs and garlic into each other and the butter, cutting and
mixing as you go. Add pink salt, black pepper, and paprika,
and mix until well blended. Pat cod filets dry. In a
12x18-inch casserole or baking pan, place each filet on top
of 2 lemon slices. Evenly divide herb butter mixture among
the filets; use a fork or offset spatula to spread herb
butter over filets. Top each filet with 2 remaining lemon
slices. Bake in the preheated oven until cod flakes easily
with a fork, 13 to 15 minutes. See note. To serve, drizzle
each filet with extra virgin olive oil, and garnish with
fresh parsley, if desired.
