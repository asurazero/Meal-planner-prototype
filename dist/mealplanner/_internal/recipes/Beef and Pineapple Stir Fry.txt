Beef and Pineapple Stir Fry


Ingredients
1 pound beef top round or top sirloin
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 ( 14-ounce) can pineapple chunks in juice,
1/2 cup beef broth
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons sambal oelek
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup red onion
1 cup carrots
7 ounces snow peas
1/2 large red bell pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons ginger
chives for garnish
hot cooked rice

Cooking Instructions

Combine beef strips and 2 tablespoons cornstarch in a bowl;
toss until beef strips are evenly coated. Set aside. To make
sauce, stir 1/4 cup reserved pineapple juice, beef broth,
soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sambal oelek or Sriracha
together in a bowl; set aside. Heat oil in a large skillet
or wok over medium-high heat. Add beef and onion to the hot
oil, and cook, stirring quickly and constantly, until beef
is browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in carrots, snow peas, and
bell pepper; cook and stir about 1 minute. Add garlic and
ginger and cook about 30 seconds. Stir in reserved sauce and
pineapple chunks. Stir remaining cornstarch with 2
tablespoons water and add to the skillet. Cook, stirring
constantly, until sauce is thickened, 1 to 2 minutes more.
Serve immediately with hot cooked rice, garnished with fresh
chives, if desired.
