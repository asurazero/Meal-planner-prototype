corn on the cob


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Gather ingredients. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.
Sprinkle each ear of corn with Cajun seasoning, salt, and
pepper, and wrap each ear with 2 slices of bacon, covering
the ear as completely as possible. (A big ear might need 3
pieces of bacon.) Wrap the ears in aluminum foil, twisting
the ends tightly to seal. Place the wrapped corn on the
preheated grill, and grill on high heat until the corn is
hot, about 10 minutes per side. Turn the heat to Low, and
grill the corn until the bacon is cooked and the corn is
tender, about 45 minutes. Enjoy!
