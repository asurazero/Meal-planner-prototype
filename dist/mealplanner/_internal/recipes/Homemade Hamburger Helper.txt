Homemade Hamburger Helper


Ingredients
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup yellow onion
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon ketchup
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 1/2 cups beef broth
1 cup elbow macaroni
6 ounces Cheddar cheese,

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot
over medium-high heat. Add beef and onion, and cook,
stirring occasionally, until beef is crumbled, browned, and
no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Spoon off and discard any
fat. Stir in tomato paste, ketchup, garlic powder, chili
powder, salt, paprika, and pepper; cook, stirring
constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add beef broth,
and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in macaroni; reduce
heat to medium, and gently boil, uncovered, stirring
occasionally, until pasta is tender and most of the liquid
is absorbed, 13 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in
Cheddar, ensuring cheese is fully melted and incorporated,
30 to 45 seconds. Let stand until thickened before serving,
about 2 minutes.
