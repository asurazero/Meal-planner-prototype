Croissant French Toast Bake


Ingredients
cooking spray
6 large eggs
1 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 large croissants (about 1 1/4 pounds), halved horizontally
confectioner's sugar

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Generously coat a 9x13-inch baking dish
with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk together eggs, milk,
heavy cream, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt in a
large bowl. Dip each croissant half in the egg mixture until
fully soaked. Arrange dipped croissants in the prepared
baking dish, overlapping as needed. Pour any remaining egg
mixture over croissants. Bake in the preheated oven until
golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out
clean, about 30 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before
serving. Serve with desired toppings.
