Chicken Chilaquiles


Ingredients
¼ pound chorizo
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch cubes
½ (10 ounce) bag tortilla chips
1 cup frozen corn kernels
1 (19 ounce) can green enchilada sauce
½ cup sour cream
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat a
large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo
in the hot skillet until crumbly, about 5 minutes. Add
chicken; cook and stir until chicken is cooked through and
no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Spread 1/2
of the tortilla chips over the bottom of a casserole dish;
top chips with chicken mixture. Sprinkle corn evenly over
chicken mixture and layer remaining chips on top. Whisk
green enchilada sauce and sour cream in a mixing bowl; pour
over chips and top with shredded Monterey Jack cheese. Bake
chilaquiles in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbly
and the chips begin to brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
