Authentic German Potato Salad


Ingredients
3 cups diced peeled potatoes
4 slices bacon
1 small onion, diced
¼ cup white vinegar
2 tablespoons water
1 ½ tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste
1 teaspoon salt
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Cooking Instructions

Gather the ingredients. Place potatoes in a large pot and
add water to cover by at least 1 to 2 inches; bring to a
boil. Cook until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork,
about 10 minutes. Drain, and set aside to cool. While the
potatoes are cooking, place bacon in a large, deep skillet
over medium-high heat. Fry until browned and crisp, 10 to 12
minutes, turning as needed. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-
lined plate and crumble when cool enough to handle. Leave
bacon grease in the skillet. Cook onion in the bacon grease
over medium heat until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add vinegar,
sugar, water, salt, and pepper to the pan and bring to a
boil. Once boiling, add potatoes, and 1/2 of the crumbled
bacon. Cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer
warm potato salad to a serving dish and sprinkle remaining
bacon over top. Garnish with parsley. Serve immediately.
