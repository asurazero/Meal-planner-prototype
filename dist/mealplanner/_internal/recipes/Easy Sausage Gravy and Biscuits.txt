Easy Sausage Gravy and Biscuits


Ingredients
1 (16 ounce) can refrigerated jumbo buttermilk biscuits
1 (9.6 ounce) package Jimmy Dean® Original Hearty Pork Sausage Crumbles
¼ cup flour
2 ½ cups milk
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange
biscuits 1 to 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 13 to
15 minutes. Meanwhile, cook sausage in a large skillet over
medium heat until thoroughly heated, stirring frequently,
about 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in flour until well combined.
Gradually add milk, stirring continuously, until the gravy
thickens and comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low;
simmer and stir for 2 more minutes. Season to taste with
salt and pepper. Split biscuits in half. Place 2 halves on
each of 8 plates; top with about 1/3 cup gravy.
