Calabrian Chili Orzo with Vegetables


Ingredients
6 ounces orzo
2 tablespoons creme fraiche
1 teaspoon chili paste,
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 zucchini,
1/2 cup sweet peppers
2 cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil, add orzo, and
cook, uncovered, until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn off the
heat, drain thoroughly, and return orzo to the pot. Add
crème fraîche and Calabrian chili paste. Set aside and keep
warm. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil.
Once oil is shimmering, add vegetables, and saute for 4 to 5
minutes. Stir in garlic, and sauté until fragrant, about 45
seconds. Add Italian seasoning and season with salt and
pepper. Remove vegetables from heat. Gently stir vegetables
into orzo. Serve immediately.
