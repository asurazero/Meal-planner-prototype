Pork Chile Verde


Ingredients
1 ½ pounds fresh tomatillos, or more to taste, husks removed
3 serrano peppers
4 cloves garlic, peeled
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons lard or vegetable oil
3 pounds pork shoulder, or more to taste, trimmed and cut into 1 ½-inch cubes
2 teaspoons garlic salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped
1 green bell pepper, coarsely chopped
½ cup red wine
1 cup low-sodium chicken stock
⅓ cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine
tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic in a bowl. Drizzle
with olive oil and toss to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet.
Place in the preheated oven and roast until tender, about 30
minutes. Remove vegetables from oven, cool slightly, and
transfer to the bowl of a food processor. Puree until
smooth. Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F (135
degrees C). While vegetables are roasting, heat lard in a
Dutch oven or heavy oven-safe pot over medium-high heat.
Sprinkle pork with garlic salt and pepper and add to the pot
in batches. Cook each batch until browned, about 7 minutes,
removing to a plate with a slotted spoon. Drain and discard
all but 2 tablespoons pan drippings. Add onion and bell
pepper to the pot. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until onion
has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour
wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the
browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden
spoon. Stir in browned pork, tomatillo puree, chicken stock,
cilantro, oregano, cumin, and salt. Cover and cook in the
oven until pork is tender, 3 ½ to 4 hours. Allow to stand
for 15 minutes, covered, before serving.
