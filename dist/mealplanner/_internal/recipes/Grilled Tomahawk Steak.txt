Grilled Tomahawk Steak


Ingredients
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon ontreal steak seasoning
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak
1/4 cup salted butter, at room temperature
1 tablespoon shallot
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chives
2 teaspoons steak rub

Cooking Instructions

To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak
seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small
airtight container; shake or stir to combine. Set aside 2
teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter. Place steak
on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and sides
with remaining steak rub until well coated. Place steak,
uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine overnight. For
compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and
the reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl. Mash
together with a fork until evenly combined. Spoon butter
into a small airtight container, cover, and refrigerate
until ready to use. Remove steak from the refrigerator 1
hour before cooking to take the chill off. It will cook on
the sheet pan that you used for dry-brining. Preheat the
oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). The reverse sear
method is used to cook this big steak, so you will need an
instant-read thermometer. If you are using a digital meat
thermometer, set the internal temperature to 110 degrees F
(43 degrees C). Bake steak on the sheet pan in the preheated
oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center reads 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), about 45 minutes.
Begin checking the temperature at 30 minutes. During the
last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time, preheat an outdoor
grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. When steak
reaches an internal temperature of 110 degrees F (43 degrees
C) measured with an instant-read thermometer, remove it from
the oven. Grill steak directly on the grates of the
preheated grill; sear on both sides, about 2 minutes per
side. This is a fatty piece of meat, so be mindful of flame
flare-ups. The internal temperature should now read 125 to
135 degrees F (51 to 57 degrees C) for medium rare. Remove
steak from the grill, and smear compound butter over top.
Let butter melt into the steak, heating up the fresh garlic,
shallots, and chives. Let steak rest for 10 minutes. Slice
steak and serve with accumulated juices and melted butter.
Be sure to serve the boneâ€“someone will want to gnaw on it!
