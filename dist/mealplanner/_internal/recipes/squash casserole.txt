squash casserole


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
spray a medium baking dish with floured cooking spray. Place
squash in a pot with enough water to cover; bring to a boil.
Cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain squash and
transfer to a bowl. Add crumbled cornbread, condensed soup,
1/2 cup Cheddar, onion, celery, margarine, egg, sugar, sage,
salt, and pepper; mix until well combined. Transfer to the
prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 45
minutes. Top with remaining Cheddar and continue baking
until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 15 minutes.
