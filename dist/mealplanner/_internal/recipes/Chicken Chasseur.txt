Chicken Chasseur


Ingredients
4 (8 ounce) chicken thighs
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt,
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 ounces cremini mushrooms
2/3 cup shallot
1 tablespoon tomato paste
4 cloves garlic
1/2 cup sweet vermouth
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 teaspoon fresh thyme
1 teaspoon fresh tarragon
2 tablespoons unsalted butter,

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
(190 degrees C). Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Season
both sides evenly with black pepper and 1 1/4 teaspoons of
the salt. Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium
heat. Add chicken, skin-side down, and cook, undisturbed,
until skin is deeply browned and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes.
Turn chicken over, and cook 2 minutes. Transfer to a large
plate, and set aside. Remove and discard all but 2
tablespoons of the drippings in the skillet. Increase heat
to medium-high. Add mushrooms, and spread into an even
layer; cook, undisturbed, for 4 minutes. Stir in shallot.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are golden
brown and tender, about 4 minutes. Add tomato paste and
garlic, and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove
from heat; add the 1/2 cup vermouth, and cook, stirring
occasionally, until almost reduced but some liquid remains,
about 1 minute. Place skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in
diced tomatoes, stock, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Nestle chicken thighs, skin-side up, in tomato mixture,
making sure chicken skin exposed and not covered by tomato
mixture. (Itâ€™s OK if some sides of skin are submerged).
Place skillet in the preheated oven, and bake, uncovered,
until a thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken
registers 175 degrees F (79 degrees C) and sauce has
thickened slightly, about 22 minutes. Remove from oven, and
transfer chicken to a large platter. Place the skillet with
mushroom mixture over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until slightly reduced or a spatula leaves a
trail when pulled across bottom of skillet, 8 to 10 minutes.
Remove from heat, and stir in thyme, tarragon, and butter
until butter has melted and sauce is velvety, about 1
minute. Add remaining 1 tablespoon vermouth, as desired.
Nestle chicken in sauce, and garnish with thyme and tarragon
leaves.
