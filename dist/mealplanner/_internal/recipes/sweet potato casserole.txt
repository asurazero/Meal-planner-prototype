sweet potato casserole


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Place sweet potatoes in a large pot
and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes; drain.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a
deep casserole dish. Mash potatoes with a potato masher in a
bowl until no large lumps remain. Stir in both sugars,
cinnamon, and butter until well combined. Transfer to the
prepared casserole dish. Cover with a layer of miniature
marshmallows. Bake in the preheated oven until marshmallows
are browned, about 30 minutes.
