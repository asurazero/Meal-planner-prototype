Slow Cooker Mojo Chicken


Ingredients
½ cup orange juice
¼ cup lime juice
¼ cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
5 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
½ teaspoon ground coriander
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water

Cooking Instructions

Combine orange juice, lime juice, lemon juice, vinegar,
olive oil, garlic, cumin, pepper flakes, coriander, salt,
and pepper in a blender or food processor. Pulse several
times until mixture is well blended and smooth. Place
chicken breasts in the bottom of a slow cooker. Pour juice
mixture over all, cover, and cook on High setting until no
longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 2 ½
hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Shred
cooked chicken with two forks, adding a little liquid from
the slow cooker, if desired. If serving as a main dish,
remove chicken to a plate, cover, and keep warm. Strain
liquid into a 1-quart saucepan and bring to a boil over
medium-high heat. Simmer until liquid is reduced to 1 cup,
about 10 minutes. Combine cornstarch and water in a small
bowl and stir until there are no lumps. Add cornstarch
mixture to the saucepan, stirring continuously. Allow
mixture to boil about 2 minutes, stirring continuously.
Remove from heat when sauce is thickened. Adjust seasonings,
if necessary.
