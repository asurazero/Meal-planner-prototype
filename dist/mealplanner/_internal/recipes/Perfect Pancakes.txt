Cooking Instructions

Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir
together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid
measuring cup. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt in a second bowl. Beat eggs in a large
bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk
together. Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and
whisk until just combined. (Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest
3 minutes and gently stir again. Melt some butter on the
griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel. (You want
just a bit of a sheen; donâ€™t overgrease the griddle.) Spoon
batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bubbles
form on surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes. Flip
pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1
1/2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve
immediately with butter and toppings.
