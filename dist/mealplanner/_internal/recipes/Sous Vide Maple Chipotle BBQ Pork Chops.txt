Sous Vide Maple Chipotle BBQ Pork Chops


Ingredients
1 cup ketchup
¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
¼ cup apple cider vinegar
¼ cup maple syrup
1 large jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon chopped canned chipotle chiles in adobo
1 tablespoon adobo sauce from canned chipotle chiles
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1 teaspoon chili powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
4 (1 1/4-inch-thick) bone-in, center cut pork chops
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Prepare a thermocirculator and water bath according to
manufacturer's directions. Set thermocirculator to 135
degrees F(57 degrees C) (if you want the pork cooked medium
instead of medium-rare, set to 145 degrees F (62 degrees
C)), and allow water bath to come up to temperature. Stir
together ketchup, melted butter, vinegar, maple syrup,
jalapeno, mustard, chipotles, adobo sauce, Worcestershire, 1
teaspoon salt, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder,
and smoked paprika for the sauce in a bowl. You should have
about 2 cups sauce. Season all chops evenly with remaining 1
1/2 teaspoons salt and pepper and place chops in an even
layer in a large vacuum sealable bag. Pour 1 cup of the
sauce into bag. Cover and chill remaining sauce. Massage bag
to be sure each chop is evenly coated in sauce, then seal
bag with a vacuum sealer according to manufacturer's
directions. Transfer vacuum-sealed chops to warm water bath
with thermocirculator, cover vessel with aluminum foil to
reduce evaporation. Cook 40 minutes (meat will be 135
degrees F to 145 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees C) when done
depending on desired doneness). Remove bag from water bath
and transfer meat from bag onto a rimmed baking sheet and
drizzle with canola oil. Preheat a grill or a grill pan to
medium-high (400 degrees F to 450 degrees F (200 degrees C
to 230 degrees C)). Grill meat, uncovered, until grill marks
appear, basting with 1/2 cup of the reserved sauce, 1 to 2
minutes per side. Serve chops with remaining 1/2 cup sauce
and a sprinkle of cilantro.
