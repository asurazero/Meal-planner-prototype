Sugar Snap Peas with Peanut Dipping Sauce


Ingredients
1/4 cup peanut butter
3 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce
1 teaspoon fresh ginger
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed
1/4 teaspoon salt
lime wedges
peanuts, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Whisk together powdered peanut butter, lime juice, tamari,
and ginger in a small bowl. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a
time, to reach a dipping consistency. Heat oil in a very
large skillet over high heat. Add peas and salt. Cook,
stirring occasionally, until peas are blistered with some
charred spots, about 5 minutes. Serve with lime wedges and
peanut sauce. Garnish sauce with chopped peanuts.
