Strawberry Mousse Shooters


Ingredients
10 ounces fresh strawberries
3 tablespoons sugar
3/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup confectioner's sugar
2 tablespoons strawberry preserves
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
fresh mint

Cooking Instructions

Add strawberries and sugar to a blender, process to a fine
puree, and set aside. Beat heavy whipping cream in a chilled
bowl using chilled beaters until frothy. Add confectioners
sugar, strawberry preserves, and almond extract, and
continue to beat until stiff peaks form, about 1 to 2
minutes. Add the strawberry puree equally to the shooter
glasses, about a quarter to a third of the way up. Spoon or
pipe the mousse on top of the puree, and garnish with fresh
mint and strawberries, if using. Move to the fridge to
chill.
