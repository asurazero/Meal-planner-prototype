Caprese Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms


Ingredients
4 mushrooms
4 teaspoons olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
5 fresh mozzarella cheese, divided
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
2 basil leaves,
1 tablespoon balsamic glaze, or as needed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking
sheet with parchment. Remove mushroom stems and remove
gills. Place mushrooms, cap side facing downward, on a wire
rack over the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated
oven until mushrooms have released their liquid, about 15
minutes. Meanwhile, whisk olive oil and minced garlic
together; season with salt and pepper. Remove mushrooms and
drain off liquid. Flip mushrooms over, and return to the
baking sheet. Place one slice of fresh mozzarella into each
mushroom cavity. Lightly drizzle olive oil mixture over
cheese. Preheat the broiler, and set a rack about 6 inches
from the heat source. Broil mushrooms until cheese is
golden, about 5 minutes. Place tomatoes in a bowl. Cut
remaining mozzarella into cubes, and combine with tomatoes.
Spoon tomato mixture evenly into mushroom caps; top with
basil, and drizzle with balsamic glaze.
