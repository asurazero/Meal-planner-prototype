Candied Jalape絪s


Ingredients
1 pound jalape침o peppers
1  cups brown sugar
 cup apple cider vinegar
췋 teaspoon garlic powder
췋 teaspoon celery seed
췋 teaspoon ground turmeric
췊 teaspoon cumin seed
췊 teaspoon anise seed
췊 teaspoon salt
췊 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 pint-size canning jar

Cooking Instructions

While wearing gloves, rinse jalape침os and remove stem. Cut
into 1/4-inch slices and set aside. To reduce the heat from
the peppers, you may core out the centers with the seeds and
discard before slicing. Combine brown sugar and apple cider
vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic powder,
celery seed, turmeric, cumin seed, anise seed, salt, and red
pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer for 3 minutes. Add sliced
jalape침o peppers and simmer for an additional 4 to 5
minutes. Remove jalape침os to a jar using a slotted spoon.
Continue simmering liquid over medium-low heat until
slightly thickened, about 10 minutes more. Pour liquid over
the jalape침os and let cool. Use a strainer to remove excess
seeds from the liquid, if desired. Refrigerate for a minimum
of 3 days before eating. Store in the refrigerator for up to
3 months.
