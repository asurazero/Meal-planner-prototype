Hot Honey Butter Cream Cheese Stuffed Bagel


Ingredients
1 bagel
1 ounce cream cheese
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon butter
flaky salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (199 degrees C)
according to manufacturer's instructions. Make 8 small cuts
in the bagel, taking care not to cut all the way through, to
create small openings. Add a piece of cream cheese in each
crevice around the bagel. Combine honey and melted butter in
a small dish and coat the stuffed bagel liberally. Sprinkle
with salt. Place bagel in the air fryer until golden brown,
5 to 7 minutes. Drizzle with more honey if desired.
