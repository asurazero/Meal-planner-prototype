New York Strip Steak au Poivre


Ingredients
2 (12 ounce) New York strip steaks
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
2 tablespoons peppercorns
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup shallots
4 garlic cloves
3 sprigs fresh thyme
1/3 cup cognac
1 cup heavy cream

Cooking Instructions

Pat steaks dry with paper towels; season on both sides with
sea salt. Place whole peppercorns on a wooden cutting board,
and crack peppercorns with an iron skillet or heavy pan.
Lightly pound peppercorns, then rub peppercorns in a
circular motion over the cutting board until pieces of
pepper are fairly uniform, and more coarse than ground black
pepper. Press cracked pepper into both sides of steaks; let
stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Heat butter
and olive oil in a 10-inch iron skillet over medium-high
heat. When butter stops sizzling and oil is hot, reduce heat
to medium and carefully add steaks to the hot oil. Cook
about 3 minutes per side, or until an instant-read
thermometer inserted near the center reads 120 degrees F (50
degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove steaks from pan; tent
with aluminum foil to keep warm. To the same skillet, over
medium-low heat, add minced shallots and cook until
softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and thyme sprigs; cook
until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Remove the pan from heat
and slowly and carefully pour in the cognac (adding cognac
over heat or adding too quickly could cause it to ignite).
Return the pan to the burner and stir to combine. Cook until
the liquid is evaporated. Stir in cream; continue cooking
until sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. To
serve, spread sauce on a serving platter. Slice steaks
thinly on the diagonal, and place on the sauce. Garnish with
additional thyme sprigs, if desired.
