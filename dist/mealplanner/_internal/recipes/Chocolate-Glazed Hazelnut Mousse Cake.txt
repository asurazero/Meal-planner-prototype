Chocolate-Glazed Hazelnut Mousse Cake


Ingredients
2 tablespoons hazelnuts, toasted and skins rubbed off
3 tablespoons sugar
½ cup all-purpose flour
¼ cup unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
⅛ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
3 tablespoons cold water
½ cup chocolate hazelnut spread such as Nutella
½ cup mascarpone
1 ½ cups chilled heavy cream
2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
3 tablespoons sugar
5 tablespoons heavy cream
3 ½ ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), chopped

Cooking Instructions

For shortbread base: Put oven rack in middle position and
preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Invert bottom of springform
pan (to make it easier to slide shortbread base off bottom),
then lock on side of pan and line bottom with a round of
parchment paper. Pulse hazelnuts with sugar in a food
processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add flour, butter,
cocoa, and salt and pulse just until a dough forms. Press
dough evenly onto bottom of springform pan with your
fingers. Prick all over with a fork, then bake until just
dry to the touch, about 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer base in
pan to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Remove
side of pan and carefully slide out parchment from under
shortbread, then reattach side of pan around shortbread
base. Make mousse while shortbread cools: Sprinkle gelatin
over water in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan and let
stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Heat gelatin mixture
over low heat, stirring, just until gelatin is melted, about
2 minutes. Whisk in chocolate hazelnut spread until combined
and remove from heat. Whisk together mascarpone and
chocolate hazelnut mixture in a large bowl. Beat together
cream, cocoa powder, and sugar in another large bowl with an
electric mixer at low speed until just combined, then
increase speed to high and beat until cream just holds soft
peaks. Whisk one third of whipped cream into mascarpone
mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whipped cream
until well combined. Spoon filling onto shortbread base in
pan, gently smoothing top, then chill, covered, at least 3
hours. Make ganache and glaze cake: Bring cream to a simmer
in a small heavy saucepan and remove from heat. Add
chocolate and let stand 1 minute, then gently whisk until
completely melted and smooth. Transfer ganache to a small
bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until slightly
thickened but still pourable, about 20 minutes. Run a warm
thin knife around inside of springform pan, then remove
side. Slide cake off bottom of pan and transfer to a serving
plate. Pour ganache onto top of cake and spread, allowing
excess ganache to drip down sides.
