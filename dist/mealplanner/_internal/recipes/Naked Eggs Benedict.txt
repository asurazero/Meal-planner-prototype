Naked Eggs Benedict


Ingredients
2 teaspoons butter
4 slices deli ham
2 large eggs
1 pinch salt
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon water
salt to taste
2 tablespoons unsalted butter,
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 English muffin
1 teaspoon chives to garnish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2
(5 ounce) ramekins (or 2 wells of a standard muffin tin)
with melted butter. Line each ramekin with two slices of
ham, being sure to get the edges even around the top. Crack
1 egg into a small bowl; gently transfer to a ham-lined
ramekin; repeat with the second egg. Season each egg with
salt and cayenne, to taste. Bake in the preheated oven until
the whites are just barely set, and the yolks are still soft
and a little runny, 20 to 25 minutes. The eggs will continue
to cook and set more firmly once removed from the oven if
left in the hot ramekins. When eggs have 10 minutes cook
time remaining, make lemon butter sauce. Add lemon juice,
water, and salt to a small pan. Bring to a simmer over
medium heat, and simmer until liquid has reduced by about
half, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to lowest setting and add
butter slices. Start swirling and shaking the pan until
butter is almost fully emulsified, then turn off the heat.
Continue swirling pan until butter is entirely melted.
Taste; add cayenne or hot sauce if using. Keep pan in a warm
spot until needed. Sauce will thicken slightly as it cools
Toast and butter English muffins, transfer baked ham and
eggs onto muffin halves, and spoon warm sauce over. Sprinkle
with chives and serve immediately.
