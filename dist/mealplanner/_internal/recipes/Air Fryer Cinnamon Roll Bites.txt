Air Fryer Cinnamon Roll Bites


Ingredients
1 (12.4 ounce) cinnamon rolls
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon orange peel
1 tablespoon orange juice
icing

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Add sugar and
cinnamon to a large resealable plastic bag, and shake to
combine. Remove the 8 cinnamon rolls from the can, and set
icing aside. Cut each roll into 4 equal pieces for a total
of 32 bites. Line the fryer basket with parchment paper.
Place the bites in a single layer in the bottom of the
basket, cook for 3 minutes, turn over using tongs, and cook
until golden brown, another 2 to 3 minutes. Depending on the
brand and size of your air fryer, you may have to cook in
batches, and your timing may vary, so watch closely.
Meanwhile, prepare the dip. Add cream cheese, confectioner’s
sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and the packaged icing to
a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed
until you reach a dipping consistency, about 1 minute. Drop
the warm pieces into the sugar-cinnamon mixture, and shake.
Transfer to a plate or basket, and serve with the dip.
