Hot German Potato Salad


Ingredients
9 potatoes, peeled
6 slices bacon
¾ cup chopped onions
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons salt
½ teaspoon celery seed
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
¾ cup water
⅓ cup distilled white vinegar

Cooking Instructions

Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water;
bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until
tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, cool, and slice thin. Place
bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat
until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside, reserving
drippings. Sauté onions in bacon drippings over medium heat
until they are golden brown. Whisk flour, sugar, salt,
celery seed, and pepper together in a small bowl; stir into
onions and cook until bubbling, then remove from heat. Stir
in water and vinegar; bring to a boil over medium heat,
stirring constantly, and simmer for one minute. Gently stir
bacon and sliced potatoes into the onion mixture until
potatoes are heated through.
