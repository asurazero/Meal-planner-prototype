Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease 2 baking sheets. Make the cookies: Beat brown sugar
and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until
light and fluffy. Add eggs and mix well. Mix together flour,
cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate
bowl. Add flour mixture to wet ingredients in 2 batches,
alternating with boiling water, mixing batter after each
addition until well combined. Stir in oats. Drop spoonfuls
of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, switching
racks halfway through. Remove from the oven and transfer to
wire racks to cool. While the cookies are cooling, make the
filling: Beat 1 cup confectioners' sugar, egg white, milk,
and vanilla until combined. Beat in shortening and remaining
1 cup confectioners' sugar until light and creamy. Spread
filling onto 1/2 of the cooled cookies, then sandwich with
remaining cookies.
