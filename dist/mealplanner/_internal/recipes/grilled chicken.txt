grilled chicken


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Lightly spray a skillet with cooking spray and heat over
medium heat. Add onion and saut√© until translucent, about 5
minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30
seconds. Add carrots, bell pepper, tomato, and mushrooms;
cook and stir until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the
heat and let cool completely, about 20 minutes. Preheat an
outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix
ground chicken and cooled vegetables together in a large
bowl. Add bread crumbs, egg, seafood seasoning, salt, and
pepper; mix until well combined. Form mixture into eight
patties. Cook on the preheated grill until no longer pink in
the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes per
side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
