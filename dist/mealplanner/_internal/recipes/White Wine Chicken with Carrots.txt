White Wine Chicken with Carrots


Ingredients
6 skinless boneless chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup low-sodium chicken stock
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 pound carrots,
2 tablespoons capers
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or as needed, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels; sprinkle with salt
and pepper. Heat oil in a very large skillet over medium
heat. Add chicken thighs; cook, turning halfway through,
until browned, about 8 minutes. Remove from skillet and keep
warm. Add garlic and wine to skillet, then use a wooden
spoon to scrape up any browned bits from bottom of pot.
Cook, stirring, until liquid is reduced by half, about 2
minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together chicken stock and
cornstarch. Add stock mixture to skillet; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 minute. Add chicken and
lemon juice to the skillet. Cook, covered, 4 minutes. Add
carrots and cook, covered, until carrots are tender and an
instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of
chicken registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 3
minutes. Gently stir capers and butter into sauce. Serve
chicken and carrots with pan sauce and garnish with
Parmesan.
