Zucchini Chicken Casserole


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 (8 ounce) zucchini, thinly sliced
2 large carrots, chopped
1 cup yellow onion
2 (10 1/2 ounce) cans cream of chicken soup
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons fresh herbs
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
4 cups rotisserie chicken breasts
4 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 1/4 cups panko breadcrumbs
2 1/2 tablespoons salted butter, melted

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Lightly spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with
cooking spray; set aside. Heat oil in a large nonstick
skillet over medium-high heat. Add zucchini slices, carrots,
and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are
softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Whisk together cream of chicken soup, sour cream, herbs,
salt, and black pepper in a large bowl until evenly
combined. Fold chicken and cooked zucchini mixture into
cream of chicken soup mixture until evenly coated. Transfer
to prepared baking dish, spreading into an even layer. Top
with shredded Cheddar. Stir panko and butter together in a
small bowl until fully combined. Sprinkle evenly over top of
casserole. Bake in the preheated oven until Cheddar is
melted, chicken mixture is bubbling around edges, and panko
is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Garnish with additional
fresh herbs.
