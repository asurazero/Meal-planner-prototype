Baked Apple Fritters


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup whole milk
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup oneycrisp apple
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons whole milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together all-
purpose flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg,
and salt in a large bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry
blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk milk,
egg, and vanilla extract together in a cup. Stir into flour
mixture just until combined; stir in chopped apple. Use a
scoop or spoon to drop 1/4-cup mounds onto prepared baking
sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted
near the center of fritter comes out clean, 11 to 12
minutes. Remove to a wire rack. Preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler.
Whisk together confectioner's sugar, milk, and vanilla
extract. Brush a thin layer of glaze over fritters, and
place under broiler. Broil fritters until glaze is bubbly,
about 2 minutes.
