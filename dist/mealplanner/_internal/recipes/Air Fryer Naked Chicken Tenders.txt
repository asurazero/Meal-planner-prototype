Air Fryer Naked Chicken Tenders


Ingredients
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper, or to taste
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 pound chicken tenderloins
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 tablespoon fresh parsley
4 wedges lemon (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (199 degrees C)
according to manufacturerâ€™s directions. Add cumin,
coriander, pepper, garlic powder, and salt to a small bowl,
and stir until well combined. Pat the tenders dry with a
paper towel, drizzle tenders with olive oil, and rub both
sides, pressing down, with the spice mixture until well
coated with oil and spices. Place tenders in a single layer
in the air fryer basket, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes,
flipping halfway through. If using a meat thermometer to
check for doneness, internal temperature should reach 165
degrees F (74 degrees C) in the thickest part. Depending on
the brand and size of your air fryer, you may have to cook
in batches, and timing may vary. Remove from the air fryer,
garnish with chopped parsley, and serve with a wedge of
lemon.
