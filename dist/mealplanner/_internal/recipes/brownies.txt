Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
9x13-inch baking dish. Make peanut butter batter: Beat cream
cheese, peanut butter, sugar, egg, and milk in a medium bowl
until smooth. Set aside. Make brownie batter: Mix together
sugar, melted butter, and vanilla in a large bowl until
combined. Mix in eggs one at a time, beating well after each
addition. Combine flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt in a
separate bowl; mix into batter until well combined. Stir in
chocolate chips until incorporated. Set aside 1 cup brownie
batter. Spread remaining brownie batter into the prepared
dish. Spread peanut butter batter on top. Drop reserved
chocolate batter by teaspoonfuls over the top. Using a
knife, gently swirl through the top layers for a marbled
effect. Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden toothpick
inserted near the center comes out almost clean, 35 to 40
minutes. Cool completely, then cut into bars.
