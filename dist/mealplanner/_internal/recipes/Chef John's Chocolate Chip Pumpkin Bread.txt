Chef John's Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Bread


Ingredients
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 can pumpkin puree
1/2 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons milk
2 large eggs
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup pumpkin seeds

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Butter a
9x5-inch loaf pan. Whisk flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon,
ginger, cloves, and nutmeg together in a bowl. In another
bowl, combine pumpkin, white sugar, brown sugar, vegetable
oil, milk, and eggs. Whisk together until smooth. Add the
flour mixture, and whisk in gently until the flour almost
disappears. Stir in the chocolate chips and pumpkin seeds
until evenly distributed. Use a spatula to transfer batter
into the prepared loaf pan. Tap the pan on the table a few
times to bring air bubbles to the surface. Bake in the
preheated oven until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted
near the center comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Let cool
in the pan about 45 minutes; remove to a wire rack to cool
completely before slicing.
