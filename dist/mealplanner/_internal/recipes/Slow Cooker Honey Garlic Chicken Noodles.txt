Ingredients
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup lower-sodium soy sauce
6 medium garlic cloves
2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
1 tablespoon Sriracha chile sauce
1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
2 teaspoons fresh ginger
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 pounds chicken thighs
2 tablespoons tap water
1 tablespoon cornstarch
16 ounces lo mein noodles

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Stir together honey, soy sauce,
garlic, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, Sriracha, Shaoxing
wine, ginger, sesame oil, and salt in a 6-quart slow cooker.
Place chicken thighs in a single layer into the honey
mixture. Cover and cook until chicken is tender, about 3
hours on HIGH and 5 hours on LOW. Stir together water and
cornstarch in a small bowl until smooth. Transfer chicken
from the slow cooker to a cutting board and shred with a
fork. With slow cooker on HIGH, stir in cornstarch mixture
until slightly thickened, about 30 seconds. Turn off slow
cooker. Return shredded chicken to slow cooker along with
cooked noodles and scallions; toss to coat. Divide noodle
mixture evenly among 6 serving bowls, and garnish with
scallions and sesame seeds.
