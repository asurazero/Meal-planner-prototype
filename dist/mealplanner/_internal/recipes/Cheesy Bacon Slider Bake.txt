Cheesy Bacon Slider Bake


Ingredients
1 (18 ounce) package Hawaiian sweet rolls
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
½ (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes with garlic and onion
1 ½ teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
12 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
½ cup butter
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
9x13-inch baking pan. Place rolls, without separating them,
on a flat work surface. Cut in half horizontally. Arrange
bottom half in the prepared pan. Sprinkle 1 cup Cheddar
cheese on top. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is
melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Cook and stir beef and onion in a
skillet until beef is browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain grease.
Stir in tomatoes, 1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, 1 1/2
teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook until
fully combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Spoon beef mixture over
rolls. Sprinkle remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese and bacon on
top. Cover with top half of rolls. Combine butter, brown
sugar, 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, and 2 teaspoons
Worcestershire sauce in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and
microwave on high until butter is melted, about 1 minute.
Stir until blended and pour over rolls. Sprinkle sesame
seeds on top. Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until
golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
