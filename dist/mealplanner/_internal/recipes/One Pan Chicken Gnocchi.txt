One Pan Chicken Gnocchi


Ingredients
1 teaspoon butter
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 (8 ounce) boneless chicken breasts
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons butter
1 pound gnocchi
2 cups broccoli florets
1 zucchini
1 yellow squash
1/2 cup mushrooms
1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup red bell pepper
2 teaspoons butter
2 tablespoons shallot (about 1 shallot)
1 cup chicken broth
3/4 cup half-and-half
1/4 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons flour
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or more to taste

Cooking Instructions

Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat.
Slice chicken breasts in half horizontally to create thin
breasts. Sprinkle with seasonings. Place chicken in the
skillet and cook until golden brown on each side, about 4
minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and keep warm. In the
same skillet, melt butter. Add gnocchi and season with salt
and pepper. Cook until gnocchi is golden, 6 to 7 minutes.
Remove gnocchi to a bowl. Add broccoli, zucchini, squash,
mushrooms, and bell pepper and season with Italian
seasoning. Saute until vegetables are crisp and tender, 5 to
7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the vegetables. Add
minced garlic during the last 45 seconds; quickly saute
until fragrant. Remove vegetables to the same bowl with
gnocchi. Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the same skillet; and
cook shallot until softened and fragrant, about 3 minutes.
Pour in chicken broth, half-and-half, and heavy cream. Whisk
in flour, and cook, whisking to prevent lumps, until
thickened, about 3 minutes. Squeeze in lemon juice to taste.
Combine gnocchi and vegetables with cream sauce, and top
with cooked chicken.
