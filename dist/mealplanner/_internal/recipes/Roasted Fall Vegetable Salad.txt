Roasted Fall Vegetable Salad


Ingredients
2 cups russels sprouts (10 ounces)
2 cups butternut squash
1 red bell pepper, cut into 3/4-inch pieces
1 red onion, cut into 3/4-inch pieces
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon fresh herbs
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ijon mustard
2 tablespoons pepitas

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
large baking sheet with foil. Spread Brussels sprouts,
squash, bell pepper, and red onion on prepared baking sheet.
Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper; toss to coat. Roast vegetables in the preheated
oven, stirring halfway through, until browned and tender,
about 20 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes. Meanwhile, for
vinaigrette, whisk together vinegar, herbs, garlic, and
mustard in a large bowl. Slowly pour in remaining 2
tablespoons oil, whisking until oil is incorporated and
dressing is smooth and creamy. Add vegetables to bowl with
vinaigrette; toss. Let cool to room temperature (or chill,
covered, up to 1 week). Sprinkle salad with pepitas just
before serving.
