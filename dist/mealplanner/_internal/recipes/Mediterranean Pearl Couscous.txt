Mediterranean Pearl Couscous


Ingredients
2/3 cup Israeli couscous
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons pine nuts
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 medium zucchini
2 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon capers
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes

Cooking Instructions

Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil, add couscous,
and cook until tender, about 14 minutes. Remove from heat.
Reserve 1/4 cup cooking water, drain couscous thoroughly,
and return to the pot. Meanwhile, heat a nonstick pan over
medium-high heat until hot. Add pine nuts and toast,
stirring frequently, until golden brown and fragrant, 1 to 3
minutes. Remove pine nuts from skillet and set aside. Melt
butter in the same skillet. Add zucchini; saut√© for 3 to 4
minutes. Add garlic and capers. Cook on medium-high,
stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Stir in diced tomatoes; season with salt and pepper. Cook,
stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced in volume, 3
to 5 minutes. Stir in couscous and toasted pine nuts. If the
sauce seems dry, gradually add reserved cooking water, 1
tablespoon at a time, until sauce is desired consistency.
Serve immediately.
