Shredded Chicken Tacos


Ingredients
¼ cup water
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 teaspoons white distilled vinegar
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons ground oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon white sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts
8 taco shells, warmed

Cooking Instructions

Mix water and seasoning mix in a large bowl. Add tomato
sauce, vinegar, garlic, oregano, cumin, and sugar; mix well.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per
side. Add tomato sauce mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no
longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20
minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove chicken breasts from the pan and shred meat with two
forks when cool enough to handle. Return shredded chicken to
the pan with the tomato sauce. Cook and stir until chicken
is coated with sauce and sauce reduces a bit, about 5
minutes. Transfer chicken and sauce to a serving bowl and
spoon onto taco shells.
