German Rhubarb Almond Cake


Ingredients
6 cups peeled and chopped rhubarb
¾ cup white sugar
7 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
⅓ cup white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white wine
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 large egg
1 cup almond flour
¾ cup crème fraîche
2 tablespoons crème fraîche
⅔ cup white sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Cooking Instructions

For the rhubarb filling: Combine rhubarb and sugar in a
large bowl. Mix to combine and set aside to allow the
rhubarb to release some juice, about 1 hour. For the cake:
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light
and fluffy. Add flour, wine, baking powder, and egg; mix
together to form a dough. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and
place in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
9-inch springform cake pan. Roll dough out on a lightly
floured surface into a circle slightly larger than the
diameter of the cake pan. Transfer to the prepared cake pan,
letting the dough come up the sides by about 1 inch. Drain
rhubarb and evenly scatter over the dough; bake in the
preheated oven for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make the custard
filling: beat almond flour, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons crème
fraîche, sugar, eggs, vanilla sugar, and cinnamon together
until smooth. Remove cake from oven after 45 minutes; top
with almond custard mixture and use a spatula to spread it
evenly to the sides of the pan. Return cake to the oven and
bake until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes more. Allow
the cake to cool in the pan before slicing.
