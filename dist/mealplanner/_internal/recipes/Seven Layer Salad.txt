Seven Layer Salad


Ingredients
1 pound bacon
1 large head iceberg lettuce - rinsed, dried, and chopped
1 red onion, chopped
1 (10 ounce) package frozen green peas, thawed
10 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup chopped cauliflower
1 ¼ cups mayonnaise
⅔ cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons white sugar

Cooking Instructions

For the salad: Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over
medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper
towels; crumble and set aside. Place chopped lettuce in a
large glass dish or bowl; top with a layer of red onion,
peas, shredded cheese, cauliflower, and bacon. For the
dressing: Whisk mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, and sugar
together in a bowl until smooth. Drizzle over salad and
refrigerate until chilled.
