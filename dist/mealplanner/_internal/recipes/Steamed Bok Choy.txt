Steamed Bok Choy


Ingredients
1 pound baby bok choy
1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for drizzling
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons shallots
2 tablespoons white vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
4 lime wedges

Cooking Instructions

Remove any discolored outer leaves from baby bok choy, trim
the bottom of the stalks, and slice in half lengthwise.
Bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer over medium heat in
a large pot with a steamer basket. Arrange bok choy in the
basket, cut side up. Cover; steam until stems are tender, 4
to 7 minutes, depending on the size of the stalks. To check
for tenderness, insert the tip of a knife into the stem.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium-low
heat. Add garlic and shallots, cook for about 1 minute, stir
in vinegar, and cook for 1 additional minute. Transfer bok
choy to a plate, spoon garlic mixture over the top, and
drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, and
serve with a wedge of lime.
