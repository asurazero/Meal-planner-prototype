Asparagus and Eggs


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 garlic clove
8 asparagus stalks, trimmed
2 large eggs
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil
and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30
seconds. Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning
asparagus often to ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes.
Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs over the asparagus.
Cover with lid and cook until egg whites are firm and yolk
is done to desired consistency, about 4 minutes. Season with
salt and pepper; sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve
immediately.
