Best Tuna Casserole


Ingredients
1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles
2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained
1 cup frozen green peas
½ (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms
¼ cup chopped onion
1 cup crushed potato chips

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Fill a large pot with lightly salted
water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil
until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes; drain.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
C). Mix noodles, condensed soup, 1 cup cheese, tuna, peas,
mushrooms, and onion in a large bowl until well combined.
Transfer the mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top the
mixture with crushed potato chip and remaining 1 cup of
cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly,
about 15 to 20 minutes. Serve hot and enjoy!
