Cooking Instructions

Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp, about
5 minutes. Remove bacon and set aside. Add onion and garlic
and cook in bacon grease until onion is soft and
translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in cabbage, paprika,
sugar, salt, and pepper; mix to combine. Cook for about 10
minutes. Stir cooked bacon into the skillet with the cabbage
mixture. Simmer over low heat until cabbage reaches the
desired consistency, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve hot or warm.
