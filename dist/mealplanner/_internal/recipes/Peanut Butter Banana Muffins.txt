Peanut Butter Banana Muffins


Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/3 cup peanut butter
1 cup white sugar
2 large bananas
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons peanut butter
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 cup confectioner's sugar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a
12-cup muffin tin with paper liners, or grease cups. Whisk
together flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda; set
aside. Beat butter, peanut butter, and sugar together in a
bowl with an electric mixer or whisk until light and fluffy.
Add bananas and beat again until light and fluffy. Mix in
eggs one at a time; stir in milk and vanilla. Add flour
mixture; mix on low speed until about 75% of flour is
incorporated. Use a spatula to stir in chocolate chips, and
to fully incorporate flour. Divide batter evenly between
prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a
toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 23 to 25
minutes. Cool muffins in the tin for about 15 minutes;
transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes
more. For icing, combine peanut butter, milk, and powdered
sugar in a bowl and stir until a thick icing is formed. Add
more powdered sugar as needed for an icing thick enough to
hold its shape when piped. Add icing to a piping bag and
pipe in a zigzag pattern over cooled muffins.
