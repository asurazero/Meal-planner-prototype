Cobb Salad


Ingredients
6 slices bacon
3 eggs
1 head iceberg lettuce, shredded
3 cups chopped, cooked chicken meat
2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
Â¾ cup blue cheese, crumbled
3 green onions, chopped
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced
1 (8 ounce) bottle Ranch-style salad dressing

Cooking Instructions

Place eggs in a saucepan and cover completely with cold
water; bring to a boil, then cover and remove from heat. Let
eggs sit for 10 to 12 minutes, then cool, peel and chop.
While the eggs are cooking, place bacon in a large, deep
skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown, 7 to
10 minutes. Drain, crumble, and set aside. Divide shredded
lettuce among individual plates. Top with rows of bacon,
eggs, chicken, tomatoes, blue cheese, green onions, and
avocado. Drizzle with dressing.
