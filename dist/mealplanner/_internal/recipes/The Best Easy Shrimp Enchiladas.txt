Ingredients
32 extra-large raw shrimp
½ teaspoon salt, or more as needed
1 pinch cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons avocado oil, plus more as needed
1 cup diced poblano pepper or other green chili pepper
1 cup onion
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon chipotle pepper
3 cloves garlic, minced
½ cup water
2 ounce ) cans lobster bisque soup
2 tablespoons tomato paste (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
8 (6-inch) flour tortillas
6 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
6 ounces heddar cheese, shredded
1 jalapeño, thinly sliced, or more to taste
2 radishes, thinly sliced, or more to taste
½ cup sour cream, or as needed
hot sauce, as needed
1 lime, cut into wedges for serving

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Season
shrimp with salt and cayenne in a bowl and toss with tongs
to evenly coat. Add 1 tablespoon of avocado oil to a
skillet, and set on medium-high heat. Place shrimp, without
crowding, in a single layer in the skillet; sear for 30 to
60 seconds per side, then transfer to a bowl. You will have
to work in batches. Place seared shrimp in the refrigerator.
Add peppers, onions, and a large pinch of salt to the
skillet. Reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring up the
brown bits from the bottom of the pan, until onions begin to
turn translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with chili powder,
smoked paprika, cumin, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and
garlic; sauté for 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove 8 rounded
tablespoons of the mixture to a bowl and set aside. Pour
water into the pan and stir to deglaze the bottom. Stir in
lobster bisque, plus a few tablespoons of water used to
rinse the cans. Add tomato paste and raise heat to medium-
high; stir until well combined. Bring sauce to a simmer,
reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, remove shrimp from the
refrigerator, and pour any accumulated juices from the
shrimp into the sauce. Turn off heat, stir in cilantro, and
season with salt and black pepper to taste. Transfer half
the sauce into the bottom of a large (15x10-inch) baking
dish. Brush each tortilla on both sides with avocado oil.
Toss Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese together in a bowl.
Top each tortilla with 1/4 cup cheese mixture, followed by 4
shrimp. Top with 1 spoon of reserved veggie mixture. Add 2
tablespoons cheese mixture on top and roll up tortilla,
finishing with seam on bottom. Place 8 rolled enchiladas
into the baking dish, seam on bottom, and top with remaining
sauce. Sprinkle over remaining cheese, or more if desired.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top starts to brown,
and the sauce is bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Let enchiladas
rest for about 10 minutes before serving. While resting,
garnish with thinly sliced jalapeños and radishes. Serve
with extra sauce from the bottom of the dish spooned over.
Garnish with additional sliced jalapeño, radish, and chopped
cilantro, and serve with sour cream, hot sauce, and fresh
lime wedges.
