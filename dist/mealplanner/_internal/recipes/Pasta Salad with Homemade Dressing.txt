Pasta Salad with Homemade Dressing


Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) package uncooked tri-color rotini pasta
6 ounces pepperoni sausage, diced
6 ounces provolone cheese, cubed
1 medium red onion, very thinly sliced and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 small cucumber, thinly sliced
¾ cup chopped green bell pepper
¾ cup chopped red bell pepper
1 (6 ounce) can pitted black olives, drained
¼ cup minced fresh parsley
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
½ cup olive oil
¼ cup red wine vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon ground mustard seed
¼ teaspoon salt
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Bring a large pot of lightly salted
water to a boil. Add rotini and cook until tender yet firm
to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water,
and drain again. Transfer drained, cooked pasta to a large
bowl. Add pepperoni, provolone cheese, red onion, cucumber,
bell peppers, olives, parsley, and Parmesan cheese. Mix
olive oil, vinegar, garlic, basil, oregano, ground mustard,
salt, and pepper for dressing in a jar with a lid. Seal the
jar, and shake until well combined. Pour dressing over the
pasta salad; toss until well coated. Serve immediately, or
cover and chill in the refrigerator for up to 8 hours before
serving.
