Beef Enchilada Bake


Ingredients
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 large bell pepper, any color, diced
1 pound ground beef
1 (15 ounce) can chili beans
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon cumin
1 (15 ounce) can enchilada sauce, divided
12 corn tortillas
12 ounces exican blend shredded cheese
cilantro, for garnish (optional)
sour cream, for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat a
large skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil, then add
onions. Sauté until onions just start to soften, 2 to 3
minutes. Add bell pepper; sauté 1 to 2 minutes. Add garlic
and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ground beef;
cook, breaking up beef with a spatula, until browned and
crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain any grease. Stir in chili
beans. Season with salt, black pepper, and cumin. Stir in 1
cup enchilada sauce, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer,
uncovered, for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, spread remaining
enchilada sauce evenly in the bottom of a 10x8-inch baking
dish. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut a straight edge off
one side of the tortillas. Place 4 tortillas with the cut
edge facing the sides of the dish. Spread half of the beef
mixture over tortillas and top with 3 ounces cheese. Add
another layer of tortillas, then beef mixture and 3 ounces
cheese to create the second layer. Repeat layers ending with
remaining cheese. Cover with foil. Bake in the preheated
oven for 15 minutes. Remove foil; bake until cheese is
lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven;
allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Garnish
with sour cream and chopped cilantro if desired.
