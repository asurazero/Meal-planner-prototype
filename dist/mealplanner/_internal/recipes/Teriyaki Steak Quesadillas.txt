Teriyaki Steak Quesadillas


Ingredients
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup mirin
1/4 cup sake
4 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon ginger
1 Thai chili or bird's eye chili pepper
1 pound skirt steak, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups broccoli florets
8 10-inch) flour tortillas
1 1/4 cup quesadilla cheese
1/3 cup mini bell pepper
sesame seeds
green onions
Yum Yum sauce (optional)
teriyaki sauce (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Add soy sauce, mirin, sake, garlic, brown sugar, ginger, and
Thai chili to the jar of a blender. Blend on high until
smooth. Reserve 2 tablespoons marinade; pour remaining
marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add steak to the
resealable bag, close the bag, and marinate in the
refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove steak
from the marinade, shake off excess, and cook and stir steak
in the skillet until browned, about 5 minutes. Discard the
remaining marinade. Meanwhile add broccoli to a microwave-
safe steamer, and steam in the microwave until tender, about
3 minutes. Roughly chop the broccoli. Remove steak to a
plate to keep warm, and drizzle with the 2 tablespoons
reserved marinade. Rinse the skillet and dry with a paper
towel. Place 1 tortilla in the skillet, and add a 1/8
portion each of cheese, steak pieces, broccoli, and bell
pepper to tortilla. Fold tortilla in half. Press down with a
spatula, and cook until tortilla begins to brown and cheese
melts, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn quesadilla over; cook
until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes more.
Repeat with remaining ingredients. Cut quesadillas into
wedges. Sprinkle with black sesame seeds and green onions;
serve with Yum Yum sauce and teriyaki sauce, if desired.
