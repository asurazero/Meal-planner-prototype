alfredo sauce pasta


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Soak cashews in 1 1/2 cups water in a bowl until softened,
at least 20 minutes. Drain water; add almond milk. Blend
mixture in an electric blender or food processor until
smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup water, or as
needed, until sauce is slightly thinner than you want it for
the final product, as it thickens when heated. Add garlic,
nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; blend
until smooth. Pour mixture into a saucepan. Heat on medium-
low heat, stirring occasionally until heated through and
desired thickness is achieved, about 5 minutes. You can add
additional water or almond milk if sauce becomes too thick.
