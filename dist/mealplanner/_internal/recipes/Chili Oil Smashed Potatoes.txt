Chili Oil Smashed Potatoes


Ingredients
1.5 lb red baby potatoes
2 tablespoons chili oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
salt to taste

Cooking Instructions

Put potatoes in a saucepan and with enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil; cook until potatoes are fork tender, 15 to
20 minutes. Drain; cool for 5 minutes. Preheat the oven to
450 degrees (230 degrees C). Generously grease a baking
sheet. Place each potato onto the prepared baking sheet and
use the bottom of a sturdy cup or glass to smash them down
to about 1/4-inch thick. Stir together chili oil and crushed
garlic; brush mixture over potatoes and season with salt.
Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until crispy, about 20
minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.
