pineapple ham


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

In a saucepan, combine the pineapple and sugar. Bring to a
boil, then cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until
thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool.
When cool, stir in the walnuts. In a medium bowl, stir cream
cheese to soften, then stir in enough milk to make it easy
to spread. Blend in the pineapple mixture. This part can be
made the day before if you like. Spread about 2 tablespoons
of the pineapple mixture onto one side of 12 slices of
bread. Top each one of these with 5 thin slices of ham. Top
with remaining bread slices.
