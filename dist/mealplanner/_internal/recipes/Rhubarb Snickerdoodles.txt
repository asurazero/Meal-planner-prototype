Rhubarb Snickerdoodles


Ingredients
1 cup diced rhubarb
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup unsalted butte
3/4 cup white sugar
1 large egg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Cooking Instructions

Combine rhubarb and 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar in a large bowl;
toss to combine. Allow to sit for at least 30 minutes or
until rhubarb begins to release its juices. Drain
accumulated juice from rhubarb; discard juice. Add
cornstarch to rhubarb and toss until thoroughly coated. Set
aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Beat butter and 3/4 cup
sugar together in a large bowl until fluffy, about 5
minutes. Add in egg and vanilla and beat for another 3
minutes. Add in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt,
and nutmeg and mix until just combined. Fold in rhubarb. In
a small bowl, mix together 3 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon.
Scoop out 1 1/2 tablespoons dough, roll into a ball, and
roll ball in cinnamon sugar until thoroughly coated. Place
dough balls 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking
sheets. Repeat with remaining dough. Bake in the preheated
oven, one baking sheet at a time, until cookies are set and
just beginning to turn golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool
cookies on the pan for 5 minutes; remove to a wire rack to
cool completely.
