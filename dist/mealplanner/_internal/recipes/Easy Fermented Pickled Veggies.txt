Easy Fermented Pickled Veggies


Ingredients
3 cups water
3 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 pound VEGETABLES)
1 bunch HERBS)
2 teaspoons peppercorns
3 cloves garlic,

Cooking Instructions

To sanitize jar, put a 1-quart wide-mouthed canning jar in a
6- to 8-quart pot; cover with tap water. (You could also use
multiple smaller wide-mouthed canning jars.) Bring to a
boil; boil 10 minutes. Using tongs, carefully remove jar
from pot, draining excess water; let jar cool slightly.
Meanwhile, for brine, stir together filtered water and salt
in a 1-quart measuring cup until salt is dissolved. Add
radishes (or other VEGETABLES), mint (or other HERBS),
peppercorns (or other KICK), and garlic to jar. Veggies can
be packed tightly; they will shrink and soften as they
pickle. Fill jar with brine; you may have brine left over.
Add a fermenting weight or an inverted, sanitized plastic
lid to keep vegetables submerged. Cover jar with a kitchen
towel, securing with a rubber band. Let stand at room
temperature for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days. Youâ€™ll
start to see bubbles forming. The vegetables will become
more tart and the brine will become cloudier the longer the
pickles stand. Remove fermenting weight and screw on metal
lid. Chill up to 3 weeks.
