Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and
cook, breaking it up with the back of a spoon, until lightly
browned and crumbly, about 8 minutes. Add onion and bell
pepper; cook until onion is softened, about 5 more minutes.
Blot any excess oil in the pan with a paper towel. Continue
to cook until sausage is cooked completely, 5 to 7 more
minutes. Remove from the heat. (This step can be done 1 day
ahead.) Spray a slow cooker with cooking spray. Add sausage
mixture, hash browns, and Cheddar cheese. Whisk eggs, milk,
salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well blended. Pour
into the slow cooker and stir until evenly combined. Cook on
Low 6 to 8 hours or on High for 3 to 4 hours, stirring after
the first hour. Serve mixture inside warmed tortillas with
desired toppings.
