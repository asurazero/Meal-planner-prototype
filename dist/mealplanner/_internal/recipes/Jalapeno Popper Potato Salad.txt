Jalapeno Popper Potato Salad


Ingredients
10 slices bacon
3 pounds red potatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (1 ounce) packet ranch seasoning mix,
1 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon pepper
4 green onions
2 jalapenos
2 tablespoons pickled jalapeno
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
8 ounces sour cream
1/3 cup mayonnaise

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2
rimmed baking sheets with foil or parchment. Arrange bacon
in a single layer on a prepared pan. Add potatoes to the
second pan and toss with oil, 2 tablespoons ranch seasoning,
salt, and pepper until well coated. Bake both pans in the
preheated oven. Cook bacon until crisp, about 15 minutes.
Remove bacon to cool on a rack. Cook potatoes until browned
and tender, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven to
cool. Crumble bacon, reserve 1 tablespoon for garnish, and
set the remaining bacon aside. When potatoes are cool enough
to handle, add to a large bowl. Add reserved bacon, green
onions, jalapenos, pickled jalapenos, jalapeno brine,
cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, and remaining ranch
seasoning. Stir until well combined. Serve immediately, or
refrigerate until ready to serve. Garnish with reserved
bacon, jalapenos, and green onion.
