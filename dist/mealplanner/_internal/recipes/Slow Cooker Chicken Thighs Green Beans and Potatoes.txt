Slow Cooker Chicken Thighs Green Beans and Potatoes


Ingredients
1 pound red potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 pounds green beans,
2 teaspoons salt,
1 teaspoon ground black pepper,
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
6 slices bacon
1 onion, diced
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 cups chicken broth
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 onion, sliced

Cooking Instructions

Set a 5-quart slow cooker to cook on the High setting. (See
note.) Place red potato pieces in the bottom of the slow
cooker. Place green beans on top of potatoes. Add salt,
pepper, and red pepper flakes. Place bacon in a large
skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain
bacon slices on paper towels. Remove bacon, crumble, and
reserve. To the same skillet, add diced onion and cook until
just softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, cook for 30
seconds, and remove the skillet from heat. Distribute
skillet contents over green beans. Pour chicken broth or
stock over all. On a sheet of foil, about 12x24 inches,
place chicken thighs on half of the sheet. Lightly season
each thigh with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with paprika.
Place a layer of onion slices over chicken thighs and
enclose seasoned chicken and onions in the foil. Fold and
pinch the edges of the foil to make a sealed packet, about
the same size as the inside of the slow cooker. Place
chicken packet on top of green beans, cover, and slow cook
until vegetables are tender, and chicken is no longer pink
at the center and juices run clear, about 4 hours on High,
or 6 hours on Low. An instant-read thermometer, inserted
near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). To
serve, place on a serving platter and sprinkle reserved
cooked bacon crumbles on top.
