Chef John’s Tortilla de Patatas


Ingredients
2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or russet potatoes, peeled
1 yellow onion
5 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 cup olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Slice potatoes and onions with a very sharp knife or
mandoline into 1/8-inch thick slices. Combine eggs, 1/2
teaspoon salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl and
whisk very thoroughly; set aside. Add 1/3 cup olive oil to a
large nonstick pan and set heat to medium-high. Add
potatoes, onions, and remaining salt. Cook, tossing and
stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, and some
onions and potatoes are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
Between stirrings, cover potatoes to reduce cooking time and
keep in moisture. For less browning, reduce heat to medium.
Stir potato mixture into egg mixture with a spatula. Cover
and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Add remaining olive oil
to an 8- or 9-inch nonstick pan, and set the pan over
medium-high heat. Pour in egg and potato mixture, and smooth
the top. Cook, covered, for about 4 minutes or until the
bottom is browned and the edges of tortilla begin to firm
up. Slide tortilla out onto a plate, cover with another
plate, and flip the plates over to invert. Slide tortilla
back into the pan, and place back over medium-high heat.
Cook, uncovered, until the tortilla is fully set, about 2
minutes more. Tortilla will spring back lightly when pressed
in the middle with a finger if eggs are fully cooked. If it
feels soft or mushy when pressed, cook for a few minutes
more, unless you prefer the tortilla less than fully set.
Slip tortilla onto a serving plate, and serve hot, warm, or
room temperature.
