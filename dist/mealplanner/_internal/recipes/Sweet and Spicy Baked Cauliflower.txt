Sweet and Spicy Baked Cauliflower


Ingredients
1 large (about 2 pounds) cauliflower, cut into small florets
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2/3 cups sweet chili sauce
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon chile garlic sauce
1 green onion, sliced
1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and set a
rack in the upper third of the oven. Line a large baking
sheet with parchment paper. Place cauliflower florets in a
large bowl. Top with olive oil, salt, and pepper; toss to
coat. Arrange cauliflower on the prepared baking sheet in a
single even layer. Bake in the preheated oven on the upper
rack until tender, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, bring sweet
chili sauce, soy sauce, and Sriracha to a boil in a small
saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low and cook
for 5 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven.
Drizzle sauce on top and gently stir to coat. Divide
cauliflower between serving plates and top with green onion
slices. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds.
