Capirotada


Ingredients
3 cups water
2 ¼ cups packed light brown sugar, divided
2 cinnamon sticks
2 loaves bolillo bread, sliced ½-inch thick, toasted (about 24 ounces)
½ cup butter, softened
3 cups shredded Oaxaca cheese (about 12 ounces)
2 cups peanuts
1 cup raisins
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or to taste
⅛ teaspoon ground cloves, or to taste

Cooking Instructions

Gather Ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Combine water, 2 cups brown sugar, and
cinnamon sticks together in a saucepan; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugar
is dissolved and liquid has reduced into a syrup, about 15
minutes. Remove cinnamon sticks from syrup using a slotted
spoon. Spread a thin layer of butter onto one side of each
toasted bread slice, and sprinkle with cinnamon, nutmeg, and
cloves. Shingle bread, butter-side up, to make two rows in a
9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle cheese, raisins, peanuts,
cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves over bread. Sprinkle remaining
remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar over the cheese. Pour cinnamon
syrup over entire dish; cover with aluminum foil. Bake in
the preheated oven until cooked through, about 30 minutes.
Cool for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.
