Bastani (Saffron and Rose Ice Cream)


Ingredients
5 large egg yolks
1/2 cup sugar
5 1/2 cups whole milk
2 tablespoons rose water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon saffron threads, crushed to a powder
1 1/2 cups whipping cream
1/3 cup pistachios
dried rose petals

Cooking Instructions

Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a medium bowl until
thick and pale yellow, 1 to 2 minutes. Warm the milk, rose
water, and vanilla in a medium saucepan over medium heat
just until mixture lightly simmers. Gradually pour milk
mixture into yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Return
mixture to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring
constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 170
degrees F (77 degrees C) and mixture is thick enough to coat
the back of a spoon, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Add
saffron, stirring until mixture takes on a deep-yellow
color, about 1 minute. Stir in whipping cream. Cover surface
with plastic wrap; chill at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.
Churn mixture in an ice cream maker according to
manufacturerâ€™s directions until it reaches the texture of
soft-serve ice cream. Add pistachios (if using) during the
last few minutes of churning. Transfer to a freezer-safe
container, cover surface with parchment paper, and freeze
until firm, at least 4 hours. Scoop into bowls. Garnish with
pistachios and rose petals. (Freeze in an airtight container
up to 1 week.)
