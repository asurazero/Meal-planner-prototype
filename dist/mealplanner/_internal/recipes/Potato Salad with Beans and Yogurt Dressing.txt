Potato Salad with Beans and Yogurt Dressing


Ingredients
1 pound red potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 cup baby lima beans
1 (5.3 ounce) container plain Greek yogurt,
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (15 1/2 ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup fresh dill
1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced and halved
1/3 cup kalamata olives
1 rib celery
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
6 cups omaine lettuce

Cooking Instructions

Place potatoes and lima beans in a large pot, and cover with
salted water by about 1 inch. Bring water to a boil, then
reduce heat, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 9 to 12
minutes. Drain and cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk
yogurt, vinegar, Dijon, salt, and pepper together in a bowl
until well combined. Add cannellini beans, dill, red onion,
Kalamata olives, celery, potatoes, and lima beans. Toss
gently until everything is well coated, and season to taste
with salt and pepper. This may be served at room temperature
or chilled. To serve, evenly divide lettuce among serving
plates, and top with potato salad.
