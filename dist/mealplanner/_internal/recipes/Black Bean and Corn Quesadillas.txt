Black Bean and Corn Quesadillas


Ingredients
2 teaspoons olive oil
3 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (10 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
¼ cup salsa
1 tablespoon brown sugar
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons butter, or as needed
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 ½ cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Cooking Instructions

Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook
and stir onion in hot oil until softened, about 2 minutes.
Stir in beans and corn, then add salsa, brown sugar, and red
pepper flakes; mix well. Cook until heated through, about 3
minutes. Remove from heat. Melt about 1 ½ teaspoons butter
in a large skillet over medium heat. Place a tortilla in the
skillet. Sprinkle with ¼ of the Monterey Jack cheese, then
top with ¼ of the bean mixture. Place another tortilla on
top; cook until the bottom is golden, then carefully flip
and cook until the other side is golden. Repeat with
remaining tortillas and filling.
