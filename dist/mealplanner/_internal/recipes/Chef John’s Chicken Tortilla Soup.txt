Ingredients
1 whole chicken
3 white onions, halved, divided
1 bunch cilantro, rinsed well
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon peppercorns
1 teaspoon oregano
2 dried chili pepper pods, seeded (optional)
3 quarts water
12 corn tortillas
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3 large tomatoes
1 sweet red pepper, halved and seeded
1 large or 2 small jalapeno peppers, halved and seeded
6 garlic cloves, peeled
1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (optional)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 lime, juiced
sour cream
avocado
chopped cilantro
shredded or crumbled Mexican cheese, such as cotija
lime wedges
sprinkle of cayenne pepper

Cooking Instructions

Combine chicken, 1 onion, stems from the cilantro bunch, bay
leaves, oregano, peppercorns, dried chili pods, and 3 quarts
of water in a large soup pot set over medium-high heat.
Bring to simmer, lower heat to medium-low, and simmer for 1
hour. Meanwhile, make the tortilla strips: Preheat the oven
to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a
silicone mat or parchment paper. Cut tortillas in half, and
then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips. Transfer tortilla
strips to the prepared baking sheet and drizzle with oil.
Add salt and toss well to coat, then spread strips out as
evenly as possible. Bake in the preheated oven until golden
brown and crispy, tossing once or twice during the cooking
time, about 30 minutes. Set aside. Carefully remove chicken
to a bowl. Reduce heat on broth to low. Let chicken rest
until cool enough to pull off the meat. Shred chicken and
refrigerate until needed. Add bones, skin, and all the
scraps back to the pot of broth, and simmer on low heat for
about 4 hours total. If broth reduces too much, just add a
splash of water. Meanwhile, after about 2 hours, make the
charred vegetable salsa: Preheat on the ovenâ€™s broiler for
high heat and set a rack about 8 inches below the heating
element. Line a baking sheet with foil and oil lightly;
place remaining 2 onions, tomatoes, sweet red pepper, and
jalapeno pepper on the prepared baking sheet. Broil
vegetables until charred, 7 to 10 minutes. Add charred
vegetables to the jar of a blender with garlic cloves,
chipotle pepper, and 1 cup water, and blend until smooth.
Pour pureed salsa into the pot, and raise heat to medium-
low. Simmer broth for another 2 hours, stirring
occasionally. Pass soup through a fine mesh strainer into a
separate pot, squeezing the chicken to get all those nice
juices; discard bones and skin in strainer. Season soup to
taste with salt. Add cumin, shredded chicken, and juice from
1 lime. Simmer 15 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Taste for seasoning, and serve with crispy tortilla strips.
Garnish with sour cream, avocado, chopped cilantro, grated
or crumbled Mexican cheese, additional lime juice, and a
sprinkle of cayenne, if desired.
