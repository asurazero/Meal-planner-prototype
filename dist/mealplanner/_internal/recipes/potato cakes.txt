Cooking Instructions

Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180
degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan; set aside.
Combine drained sweet potatoes, 1/2 cup melted butter,
sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, and pumpkin pie spice in
a large bowl. Beat until almost smooth with an electric
mixer. There may still be some small chunks of sweet potato.
Spread sweet potato mixture evenly into the prepared pan.
Sprinkle cake mix over the sweet potato mixture. Place cold
butter pieces evenly over cake mix. Sprinkle with pecans, if
using. Bake until golden brown and set, about 45 minutes.
Cool at least 20 minutes in pan before serving. Serve with
whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.
