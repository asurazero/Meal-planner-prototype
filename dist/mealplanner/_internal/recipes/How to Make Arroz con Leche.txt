How to Make Arroz con Leche


Ingredients
2 cups water
2 (3-inch long) cinnamon sticks
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 cup whole milk
1 (12-ounce can) milk
14 ounces sweetened condensed milk
1 cinnamon for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Combine water and cinnamon sticks in
a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce
heat, cover, and simmer until cinnamon releases its color
and flavor, about 5 minutes. Add rice and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and
water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir in whole milk,
evaporated milk, and sweetened condensed milk. Cook
uncovered over medium heat until mixture has thickened to
desired consistency, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm or cold.
Sprinkle each portion with ground cinnamon.
