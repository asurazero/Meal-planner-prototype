Strawberry Lemon Cheesecake Rolls


Ingredients
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 (1/4-ounce) active dry yeast
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 large eggs
1/3 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest, divided
1 3/4 cups strawberry preserves
3/4 cup cheesecake filling
1/3 cup lemon curd
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. In a small saucepan, heat 1 cup of
the milk to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C) over low heat,
about 5 minutes. Pour warm milk into a liquid measuring cup,
and stir in sugar and yeast; let sit until foamy, about 5
minutes. Beat flour, eggs, butter, salt, and 1 teaspoon of
the lemon zest with a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook
attachment on medium speed until crumbly, about 1 minute.
With mixer on low speed, slowly stream in milk mixture until
fully combined, then increase speed to medium-low, and beat
until a smooth dough forms, 8 to 12 minutes. If needed, add
more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough is too sticky.
Transfer dough to a greased 13- x 9-inch baking pan, cover,
and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1
hour. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface;
roll into a 18- x 15-inch rectangle (about 1/4 inch thick).
Spread 1 1/2 cups of the preserves evenly over bottom two-
thirds of the dough starting on 1 long side, leaving a
1/2-inch border. Carefully roll dough into a log starting at
long side with with preserves. Some of the preserves may
spill out as you roll, thatâ€™s okay. Slice dough log into 12
rolls, and arrange, cut sides down, back into greased baking
pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place, until doubled in
size, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden
brown, about 25 minutes. Brush remaining 1/4 cup preserves
evenly over rolls. Let cool slightly at room temperature,
about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together cheesecake
filling, lemon curd, lemon juice, remaining 3 tablespoons
milk, and remaining 1 teaspoon lemon zest in a medium bowl
until combined. Drizzle desired amount of lemon curd mixture
over warm rolls. Serve any remaining lemon curd mixture on
the side.
