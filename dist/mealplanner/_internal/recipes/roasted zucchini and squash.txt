roasted zucchini and squash


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Cut zucchini crosswise into 1/2-inch slices. Dip each
zucchini slice into beaten egg, then press into cracker
crumbs until both sides are coated. Shake off excess and
place in a single layer on a plate; do not stack. Heat olive
oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry zucchini in
the hot oil until crust browns and zucchini softens, about 3
minutes per side. Season with salt and pepper.
