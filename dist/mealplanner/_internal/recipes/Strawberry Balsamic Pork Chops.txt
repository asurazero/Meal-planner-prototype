Strawberry Balsamic Pork Chops


Ingredients
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
3 cups fresh strawberries
1 tablespoon honey, or to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
several fresh thyme
4 (3/4-inch thick) boneless pork loin chops

Cooking Instructions

Melt 1 1ablespoon unsalted butter in a large, non-stick
skillet over medium heat. Stir in balsamic vinegar and cook
until mixture is bubbly and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add
sliced strawberries, honey, a pinch of salt, and fresh thyme
sprigs, to taste to the skillet. Stir, and cook until
strawberries are softened and the liquid has thickened
slightly, 5 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour into a
small bowl, remove thyme sprigs, and set aside. Wipe out the
skillet, return to the burner, add the remaining butter, and
pour in olive oil. Pat chops dry; season to taste with salt
and pepper. When butter stops bubbling, add seasoned chops
and cook until browned on each side, 1 to 3 minutes. Add
strawberry mixture to the skillet, and turn each chop to
coat with the liquid. Stack strawberries on top of each
chop. Simmer until an instant read thermometer inserted near
the center of chops reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 6 to
10 minutes. Garnish with additional fresh thyme sprigs, if
desired, and serve warm.
