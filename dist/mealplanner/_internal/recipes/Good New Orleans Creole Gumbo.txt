Good New Orleans Creole Gumbo


Ingredients
1 cup all-purpose flour
¾ cup bacon drippings
1 cup coarsely chopped celery
1 large onion, coarsely chopped
1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound andouille sausage, sliced
3 quarts water
6 cubes beef bouillon
1 tablespoon white sugar
salt to taste
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste
½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning blend (such as Tony Chachere's®), or to taste
4 bay leaves
½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce
4 teaspoons file powder, divided
2 tablespoons bacon drippings
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1 pound lump crabmeat
3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Make the roux: Whisk together flour
and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over
medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking
constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This
can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk
constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue
whisking until mixture stops cooking. Make the gumbo: Place
celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work
bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are
very finely chopped. Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix
in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat,
and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and set aside. Combine water and beef
bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring
to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes
dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.
Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper
sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes,
and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix
in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.
Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet
over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15
minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the
simmering gumbo. Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire
sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more
minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just
before serving. Serve hot and enjoy!
