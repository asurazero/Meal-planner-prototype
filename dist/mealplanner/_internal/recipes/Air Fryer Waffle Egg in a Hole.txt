Air Fryer Waffle Egg in a Hole


Ingredients
1 frozen waffle
1 large large
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons shredded cheese
maple syrup to taste

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut
a hole in the center of the frozen waffle using the rim of a
cup or glass (about 2 to 3 inches in diameter). Move waffle
to a square of parchment paper, then carefully place the
parchment paper into the preheated air fryer, along with the
small center waffle. Crack egg directly into the center of
waffle hole; season with salt and pepper to taste. Close the
lid and cook until the white of the egg has started to set,
about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove small center waffle from the
air fryer. Sprinkle shredded cheese onto egg waffle, and
cook until the cheese is melted and egg white is completely
set, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer egg waffle onto a plate;
drizzle with maple syrup and serve immediately.
