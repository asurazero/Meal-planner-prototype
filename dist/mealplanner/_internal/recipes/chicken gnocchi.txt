chicken gnocchi


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Combine bacon and onion in a large skillet and cook over
medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned, about 10 minutes. Set aside. Heat oil in a pan over
medium heat. Add chicken and 1/2 of the lemon juice and cook
until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 5
to 7 minutes per side. Meanwhile, mix balsamic vinegar,
brown sugar, rosemary, red pepper flakes, and remaining
lemon juice together in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture bubbles,
5 to 7 minutes. Add tomatoes with some of their juice and
continue to simmer while chicken finishes cooking. Melt
butter in a pan over medium heat. Pan-fry gnocchi in the hot
butter until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Place a steamer
insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the
bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add spinach,
cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Place bacon
and onion onto a serving plate and top with spinach,
gnocchi, and chicken, in that order. Drizzle with tomato-
balsamic sauce.
