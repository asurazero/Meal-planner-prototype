Japanese-Style Triple-Seared Steak


Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) filet mignon
1 teaspoon avocado oil
3 tablespoons sea salt
1/3 cup Japanese whiskey
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon butter

Cooking Instructions

Before starting the triple-searing process, build a very hot
hardwood charcoal fire. Oak, mesquite or hickory are great
choices. The coals should be glowing red, and radiating
extreme heat before the meat hits the grill. Rub steak all
over with oil. Coat with sea salt until entire surface area
is completely covered. Pour whiskey into a shallow bowl; set
aside. Place steak on hottest spot on the grill, and sear
both sides, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer steak
into bowl of whiskey, and turn constantly for at least 1
minute. Most of the salt will rinse off. Place steak back
onto the hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides
again, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. You can baste steak
with a small amount of whiskey while searing. Add soy sauce
to another shallow bowl. Add steak to the bowl, and turn
constantly for at least 1 minute. Return steak to the
hottest spot on the grill for the 3rd and final sear. Grill
both sides for about 2 1/2 minutes, or until desired
doneness is reached. For a rosy-pink inside, remove when an
instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 118
to 120 F (48 to 50 degrees C). Brush steak with melted
butter, and let rest for 3 to 4 minutes. Slice and serve
with any accumulated juices from the plate.
