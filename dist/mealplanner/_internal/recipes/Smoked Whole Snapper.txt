Smoked Whole Snapper


Ingredients
2 (1 pound) snapper
3 limes
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
2 cloves garlic
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Cooking Instructions

Heat the smoker to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pat fish
dry; cut 3 small slits on each side of fish and stuff with
lime slices. In a small bowl combine olive oil, Cajun
seasoning, garlic, and parley. Coat fish with mixture. Smoke
fish until it flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes.

read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Garnish with lime wedges
to serve.
