Grilled Flounder


Ingredients
1/4 cup olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons lemon zest
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon celery salt
4 2 ounce flounder

Cooking Instructions

Whisk olive oil, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, smoked
paprika, and celery salt together in a bowl. Pour into a
resealable plastic bag. Add flounder filets, coat with the
marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate
in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill
for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook the
flounder on the preheated grill until the filets flake
easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.
