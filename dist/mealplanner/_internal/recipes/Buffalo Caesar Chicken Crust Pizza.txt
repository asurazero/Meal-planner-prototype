Buffalo Caesar Chicken Crust Pizza


Ingredients
1 (10 ounce) can chicken breast, well drained
1/3 cup Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons Buffalo sauce
1 large egg
1 (9.8 ounce) Caesar salad mix
1/4 cup celery
2 tablespoons blue cheese (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with parchment. Combine chicken, Parmesan
cheese, Buffalo sauce, and egg in a bowl and mix well. Pat
mixture firmly into a 10-inch circle on the prepared baking
sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and
toasted, about 40 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes.
Drizzle about 2 teaspoons of dressing from the salad kit
over crust. Toss half of salad mix with half of remaining
dressing packet, according to package directions. (Reserve
croutons, if desired, and remaining half of salad mix and
dressing for later use.) Place tossed salad on top of crust,
and sprinkle evenly with celery and blue cheese. Drizzle
with additional Buffalo sauce and serve immediately.
