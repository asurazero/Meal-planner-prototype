Air Fryer Truffle Polenta Fries


Ingredients
1 (18 ounce) tube polenta
1 1/2 tablespoons black truffle-infused olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoon truffle zest seasoning
2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons fresh parsley

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)
according to manufacturer's instructions. Line a baking
sheet with paper towels; set aside. Cut the tube of polenta
in half widthwise. Cut each half in half lengthwise and then
cut into 1/2-inch wide fry-shaped sticks. Whisk truffle-
infused olive oil and truffle zest in a bowl. Add fries and
gently toss to coat. Place fries in the basket of the air
fryer in a single layer. Depending on the size of your air
fryer, fries may need to be cooked in batches. Cook for 10
minutes. Shake the basket and cook 5 minutes more. Using
tongs, transfer fries to the prepared baking sheet. Garnish
with Parmesan and chopped parsley.
