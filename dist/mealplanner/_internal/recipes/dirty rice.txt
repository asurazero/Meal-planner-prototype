Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan.
Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is
tender and broth has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Mix
venison, onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, egg,
garlic, paprika, cumin, sea salt, blackened seasoning, and
cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Heat olive oil in a
skillet over medium heat; cook and stir venison mixture
until browned, about 15 minutes. Add quinoa; cook and stir
until heated through, about 2 minutes.
