Walnut Quick Bread


Ingredients
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large egg, at room temperature
1/2 cup whole milk, plus more as needed
2 tablespoons oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spray an
8 ½ x 4 ½-1inch loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray; set
aside. Spread walnuts onto a baking sheet. Toast walnuts in
the preheated oven until nuts start to turn golden brown and
become fragrant, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Whisk
flour, sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt
together in a bowl. Stir in cooled toasted walnuts; set
aside. Crack and stir egg in a measuring cup. Add milk to
the 3/4 cup measuring line. Add oil and vanilla; stir until
well combined. Pour into flour mixture; stir just until all
ingredients are moistened. Pour batter into the prepared
pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted
in the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool on a
wire rack for 15 minutes before removing from pan to cool
completely.
