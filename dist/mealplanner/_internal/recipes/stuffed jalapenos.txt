stuffed jalapenos


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease a medium baking sheet. In a medium bowl, mix together
cream cheese, sharp Cheddar cheese and mayonnaise. Stuff
jalapeno halves with the mixture. Whisk together eggs and
milk in a small bowl. Place crushed corn flake cereal in a
separate small bowl. Dip each stuffed jalapeno half into the
egg and milk mixture, then roll in corn flake cereal to
coat. Arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking
sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until
filling is bubbly and lightly browned.
