Million Dollar Potato Salad


Ingredients
4 large eggs
3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes
1/2 cup dill pickle brine, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
6 slices bacon
1/3 cup chives
1/4 cup dill pickles
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/3 cup crispy fried onions

Cooking Instructions

Gather your ingredients. Place eggs into a small pot and
cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then
remove from the heat and cover with a lid. Let sit for 10
minutes. Drain eggs and place into an ice bath to cool
completely. Peel eggs and cut into quarters, or smaller if
you prefer. Peel potatoes and cut into roughly 2-inch
chunks. Add potatoes to a large pot of cold water, season
the water generously with salt, and add 1/4 cup pickle juice
(this helps them to hold together once cooked - you can
alternatively use 2 tablespoons white vinegar). Bring to a
boil over a high heat, reduce the heat, and simmer until
potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes and
set aside. Meanwhile, make dressing: Stir Parmesan,
mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, and remaining 1/4 cup dill
pickle brine together in a bowl. Pour the dressing over the
hot potatoes and stir to coat. Taste and season with salt,
if needed, then leave to cool. Place bacon into a large
skillet and fry over medium heat, turning over to let both
sides crisp up, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove to a chopping board
and cut into bite-sized pieces. To the cooled potatoes, add
the boiled eggs, celery, chopped dill pickle, most of the
bacon and most of the chives. Mix together to combine. When
ready to serve, transfer the potato salad to a serving dish
and garnish with remaining chives and bacon, as well as the
crispy fried onions.
