Buffalo Chicken Pizza Rolls


Ingredients
1/2 cup cooked chicken
2 ounces low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese
2 1/2 tablespoons Buffalo-style hot sauce (such as Frank’s® RedHot)
1 (13.8 ounce) can pizza crust dough
cooking spray
2 tablespoons unsalted butter,
1 teaspoon ranch dressing mix
ranch dressing or blue cheese dressing, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Stir chicken, mozzarella, and hot
sauce together in a small bowl until well combined; set
aside. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a
6x20-inch rectangle using a rolling pin. Cut dough into 8
3x5-inch rectangles. Brush edges of dough lightly with
water. Place 1 tablespoon chicken mixture in the center of
each rectangle. Roll dough over filling to form a 3 1/2x1
1/2-inch log. Pinch sides to seal. Transfer to a parchment-
lined baking sheet. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C) for 2 minutes. Lightly coat the air fryer
basket with cooking spray. Working in batches, place pizza
rolls around edges of air fryer basket in 1 layer, and cook
until golden brown, about 7 minutes. While pizza rolls are
cooking, stir together melted butter and ranch dressing mix
in a small bowl. Brush cooked pizza rolls with seasoned
butter. Serve with ranch dressing, if desired.
