Air Fryer Crispy Beef and Broccoli


Ingredients
1 lb sirloin steak, cut into 1-inch pieces
3 cups broccoli florets
1 red bell pepper
4 green onions, sliced (white and green parts separated)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
cooking spray
1/3 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon fresh ginger
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 cups cooked white rice
toasted sesame seeds, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Toss
together beef, broccoli, bell pepper, white parts of green
onions, and vegetable oil in a large bowl. Coat air fryer
basket with cooking spray. Arrange meat mixture in basket.
Cook for about 5 minutes. Stir and keep cooking until meat
has reached desired doneness, e.g. 145 degrees F (62 degrees
C) for medium, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove meat mixture and let
stand for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, for sauce, stir
together soy sauce, vinegar, honey, ginger, garlic, sesame
oil, and crushed red pepper in a small saucepan. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is
reduced to 1/2 cup, about 10 minutes. Whisk together
cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Stir into
the sauce and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened,
about 1 minute. Toss beef and vegetables with sauce in a
serving dish. Top with remaining green onions. Serve with
rice and garnish with sesame seeds.
