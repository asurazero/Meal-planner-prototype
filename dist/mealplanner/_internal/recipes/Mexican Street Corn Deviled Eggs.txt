Mexican Street Corn Deviled Eggs


Ingredients
6 large eggs
3 ounces dip
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 teaspoons lime juice, or to taste
1 tablespoon cotija cheese, divided
1 tablespoon red onion
2 teaspoons chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon Tajin® Clásico Seasoning

Cooking Instructions

Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a
boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for
15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold
running water, and peel. Cut eggs in half lengthwise. Remove
yolks to a small mixing bowl; mash with a fork. Add in
Mexican street corn dip, mayonnaise, and lime juice. Stir
together with a fork until fairly smooth; stir in 2
teaspoons of cotija cheese. Fit a piping bag with a coupler
and a tip with a fairly large opening. Drop piping bag into
a tall glass and fold edges down around the glass. Spoon egg
yolk filling into the bag. Gather edges and twist together.
Pipe filling into egg whites. Alternately, spoon filling
into a resealable plastic bag, press to remove excess air,
and reseal. Cut one corner of bag off, and pipe filling into
egg whites. Or, simply spoon filling into egg whites.
Sprinkle remaining cotija cheese over eggs; scatter on onion
slivers and cilantro. Sprinkle with Tajin® seasoning and
serve.
