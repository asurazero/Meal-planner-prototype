Creamy Chicken Fajita Pasta


Ingredients
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon cumin
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Mexican oregano
1 ½ pounds chicken breasts, cut into strips
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 red onion, peeled and cut into ½-inch wedges
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 cup chicken broth, or more as needed
1 cup salsa
4 cups milk
1 pound penne pasta
1 red bell pepper, cut into ½-inch strips
1 green bell pepper, cut into ½-inch strips
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into ½-inch strips
4 cups shredded Mexican 4-cheese blend
¼ cup minced cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Combine chili powder, cumin, salt, onion powder, garlic
powder, and Mexican oregano in a small bowl for the
seasoning blend. Season chicken with half of the seasoning;
reserve remaining seasoning for later. Heat 1 tablespoon
olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken
strips and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Transfer chicken to a plate. Heat remaining oil in the same
pot. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened,
about 2 minutes. Stir in 1 cup chicken broth and salsa,
scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan
with a wooden spoon. Add milk and dry pasta to the pot and
stir to combine. Add chicken and bell peppers on top and
bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a light simmer and cook,
gently stirring every 4 to 5 minutes, until pasta is cooked
through and sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes. Try and
keep noodles as submerged as possible while cooking. If the
consistency becomes too thick, add a bit more chicken broth.
Season with remaining seasoning blend, to taste. Stir in
Mexican cheese and combine until melted. Sprinkle with
cilantro to serve.
