Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Combine ground beef, onion, and garlic in a large stockpot
over medium heat. Cook and stir until beef is browned and
crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain and discard excess grease.
Stir tomatoes, tomato sauce, chili powder, salt, and oregano
into beef mixture. Break up tomatoes while stirring and
bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer. Cover and cook,
stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Stir in beans with liquid
from the can. Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for
20 minutes.
