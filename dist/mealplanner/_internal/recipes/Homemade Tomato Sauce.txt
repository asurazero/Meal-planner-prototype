Homemade Tomato Sauce


Ingredients
10 ripe tomatoes
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 small carrots, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
¼ cup Burgundy wine
¼ cup chopped fresh basil
¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 stalks celery
1 bay leaf
2 tablespoons tomato paste

Cooking Instructions

Gather the ingredients. Bring a large pot of water to a
boil. Prepare a large bowl of ice water. Plunge whole
tomatoes in boiling water until skin starts to peel, about 1
minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in ice bath.
Let rest until cool enough to handle. Remove peels, squeeze
out seeds and chop 8 tomatoes. Puree tomatoes in a blender
or food processor until smooth. Chop remaining 2 tomatoes
and set aside. Heat butter and oil in a large pot or Dutch
oven over medium heat. Add carrots, onion, bell pepper, and
garlic; cook and stir until onion softens, about 5 minutes.
Pour in pureed tomatoes, then stir in chopped tomatoes,
wine, basil, and Italian seasoning. Place celery stalks and
bay leaf in the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low,
cover, and simmer for 2 hours. Stir in tomato paste; simmer
for an additional 2 hours. Discard celery and bay leaf and
serve.
