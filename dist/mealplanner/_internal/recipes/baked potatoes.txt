Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Season pork chops with salt and
black pepper. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a pressure cooker
over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook pork chops
in hot butter until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
Transfer pork chops to a plate. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons
butter in the pressure cooker. Sauté onion and carrots in
hot butter until fragrant, about 2 minutes; pour in broth
and Worcestershire sauce. Return pork chops to the pressure
cooker pot. Set a steamer basket on top of pork chops and
place potatoes in the basket. Close and lock the lid. Select
high pressure according to the manufacturer’s instructions;
set the timer for 13 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for
pressure to build. Release pressure using the natural-
release method, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Slice potatoes along their tops and serve with pork chops
and carrots.
