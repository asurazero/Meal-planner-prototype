Black Bean Casserole


Ingredients
nonstick cooking spray
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup chopped white onion
1 small red bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons minced, seeded jalapeño
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
2/3 cup jarred medium picante sauce or chunky salsa (such as Pace)
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 (15 ounce) can sweet whole kernel corn, drained and rinsed
1 cup chopped, seeded tomato
4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
2 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded
2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions
lime wedges, cilantro leaves, sour cream, salsa, warm corn or flour tortillas, or tortilla chips, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C). Coat an 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking
spray. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add onion, bell pepper, and jalapeño; cook, stirring
occasionally, until softened and slightly browned, 5 to 7
minutes. Stir in beans, picante sauce, water, salt, cumin,
cayenne pepper, and smoked paprika. Mash beans using the
back of a spoon or a potato masher until mixture is slightly
thickened. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer,
undisturbed, until sauce thickens and bubbles appear all
over the surface, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in corn. Transfer
mixture to the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with
tomato, Monterey Jack cheese and Cheddar cheese. Cover with
aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is
hot and cheeses are melted, 25 to 30 minutes. Sprinkle with
green onions. Let cool slightly before serving. Serve with
lime wedges, cilantro, sour cream, salsa, warm tortillas, or
tortilla chips, if desired. Enjoy!
