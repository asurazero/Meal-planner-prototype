Green Goddess Pasta Salad Is the Only Thing We’re Bringing to Potlucks


Ingredients
16 ounces pasta
1 cup frozen peas
12 spears asparagus
2 green onions
1/2 cup feta
fresh herbs
1 cup baby spinach
1 cup fresh basil
1 chives
1 small shallot
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 cup raw cashews
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 lemons
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Bring a pot of heavily salted water to a boil over medium-
high heat. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook
according to package instructions, or until the pasta is al
dente. Drain the pasta. Transfer the pasta to a large bowl
to allow to cool. Meanwhile, combine spinach, basil, chives,
shallot, garlic, cashews, Parmesan cheese, nutritional
yeast, vinegar, and lemon juice in the container of a
blender. Pulse to start blending. Add olive oil in a stream
to emulsify to desired consistency. Season with salt and
pepper. Set aside. Steam peas and asparagus until they
slightly soften and become bright green, 2 to 3 minutes.
(You can opt to blanch your vegetables here as well, or
simply microwave with a little water for the same amount of
time.) Remove from heat, rinse with cold water, drain, and
transfer on top of the pasta along with the green onions.
Add the dressing over the pasta and vegetables and toss
gently to combine. You may or may not use all of it
depending on how coated you like the pasta. Add feta and
herbs, and taste for seasoning. Enjoy immediately or
refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.
