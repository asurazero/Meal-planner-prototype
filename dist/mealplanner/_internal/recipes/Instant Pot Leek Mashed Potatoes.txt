Instant Pot Leek Mashed Potatoes


Ingredients
1 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 leek, white parts only, quartered lengthwise and finely sliced
½ teaspoon coarse salt
water to cover
⅓ cup milk, warmed
2 tablespoons butter
salt to taste

Cooking Instructions

Combine potatoes, leek, and salt in a multi-functional
pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). Add water to cover,
about 2 cups. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure
according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10
minutes. Allow about 10 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according
to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Carefully
release remaining pressure using the quick-release method,
about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain potatoes
well and return them to the pot. Select Saute function. Toss
potatoes until dried and starting to sizzle, about 3
minutes. Add butter; stir until melted. Add milk. Mash
potatoes with the back of a wooden spoon for a rustic mash,
or run them through a ricer for a smoother mash. Taste and
adjust the salt.
