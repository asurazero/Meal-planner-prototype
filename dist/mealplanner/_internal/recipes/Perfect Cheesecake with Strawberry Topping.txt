Perfect Cheesecake with Strawberry Topping


Ingredients
14 graham crackers
1/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, melted
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs
2 quarts fresh strawberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup water

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Break
graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor. Add sugar
and pulse until large crumbs form. Add butter and pulse just
until combined and mixture resembles slightly wet sand.
Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan; press mixture
lightly into the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of the
pan. Bake in the preheated oven until fragrant and slightly
golden brown around the edges, about 8 minutes. Let cool.
Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil. Place cream cheese
in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using a paddle attachment,
whip cheese on medium speed just until smooth, to avoid
incorporating too much air. Add sugar and beat until smooth,
scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add in sour
cream, vanilla, lemon juice and salt and blend until just
combined. With the mixer on low speed, add eggs, one at a
time, mixing until each egg is fully incorporated, then mix
until just combined and smooth, scraping down the sides of
the bowl as needed. Pour mixture into the prepared crust.
Wrap bottom and sides of pan well with heavy duty aluminum
foil. Place the pan inside a large deep roasting pan and set
pan in the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the
roasting pan around the cheesecake without letting any water
inside the foil wrap or the cheesecake. Bake in the
preheated oven until the center is very slightly jiggly,
about 50 minutes. Carefully remove pans from the oven and
allow cheesecake to cool in the water bath for 15 to 20
minutes. After about 10 minutes, just when cheesecake starts
to release itself from the sides, run a knife around the
sides. Remove wrapped cheesecake from water bath and place
on a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Unwrap
cheesecake and place in refrigerator until fully chilled and
ready to serve, at least 4 hours. Place 1/2 of strawberries
in a large saucepan and stir in sugar, lemon, vanilla,
cornstarch, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat,
stirring often. Reduce heat to medium high and allow mixture
to simmer until berries are softened. Using a potato masher,
mash strawberries until slightly chunky; continue to simmer
until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in
remaining strawberries, and let cool to room temperature.
Refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve cheesecake slices
with strawberry topping.
