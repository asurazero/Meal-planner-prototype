Air Fryer Tilapia


Ingredients
½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 ½ teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4 (6 ounce) tilapia fillets, thawed if frozen
cooking spray
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley (Optional)
4 lemon wedges (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine Parmesan cheese, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and
pepper in a bowl. Pat tilapia filets dry with paper towels.
Spritz both sides with cooking spray, then press both sides
of the filets into the Parmesan mixture. Shake off any
excess, then spray again with cooking spray. Place in the
basket of the air fryer. Cook until the fish flakes easily
with a fork, 6 to 8 minutes. You may need to cook the fish
in 2 batches, depending on the size of your air fryer.
Sprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.
