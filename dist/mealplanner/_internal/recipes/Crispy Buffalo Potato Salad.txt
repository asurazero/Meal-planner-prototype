Crispy Buffalo Potato Salad


Ingredients
4 tablespoons kosher salt
3 pounds potatoes
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 packet ranch seasoning
1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced, divided
2/3 cup celery, divided
1/2 cup blue cheese, divided
10 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled, divided
1/4 cup B uffalo hot sauce

Cooking Instructions

Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Add 1
tablespoon salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce
heat to medium-high; cook until potatoes are tender when
pierced with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes; drain. Preheat the
oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking
sheet with parchment or foil. Coat the prepared baking sheet
with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add potatoes in a single layer
onto the pan. Using a heavy bottomed jar or glass, smash
potatoes to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness, taking care not to
fully separate the potatoes. Drizzle smashed potatoes evenly
with remaining oil; sprinkle with remaining teaspoon salt,
1/2 teaspoon pepper, and garlic powder. Roast potatoes in
the preheated oven, until very crispy and browned, 30 to 35
minutes, flipping after 25 minutes. While potatoes are
roasting, prepare the dressing. Combine sour cream,
mayonnaise and ranch seasoning. Reserve 1 tablespoon green
onion, celery, blue cheese and bacon for garnish; add
remaining green onions, celery, blue cheese and bacon to
sour cream mixture. Stir well to combine. Add cooked
potatoes to dressing bowl and drizzle with 3 tablespoons hot
sauce. Toss mixture together til well coated. Transfer to a
serving bowl and top with reserved green onions, celery,
blue cheese, and bacon and drizzle with remaining buffalo
sauce. Serve room temp or cover and refrigerate until ready
to serve.
