Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an
8x8-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Evenly
distribute blackberries in the dish; set aside. Combine
sugar, flour, egg, butter and vanilla in a bowl and stir
until well combined. Drop by spoonfuls over fruit and spread
with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven until fruit is
