Easy Lasagna Cups


Ingredients
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup onion
1 ( 24 ounce marinara sauce
4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 ( 12 ounce jumbo pasta shells
1 cup ricotta cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons fresh parsley (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly
grease a mini muffin pan. Bring a large pot of water to a
boil over high heat. Heat a large deep skillet over medium-
high heat. Add ground beef and cook, crumbling with a spoon,
until browned, 5 to 7 minutes; drain any excess grease. Add
onion and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in
marinara, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, garlic powder, and
Italian seasoning. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat, and cook
for 20 minutes, stirring often. Add remaining 3 teaspoons
salt and pasta to boiling water and cook, stirring
occasionally, until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, rinse
with cold water, and drain well. Turn pasta shells inside
out and place 24 shells into the prepared muffin pan. Save
any broken or remaining shells for another use. Fill each
shell with about 2 teaspoons ricotta and sprinkle 1/4 cup
Parmesan cheese evenly over the ricotta. Top with about 1
tablespoon meat sauce and top evenly with mozzarella and
remaining Parmesan. Bake in the preheated oven until
slightly golden around the edges and bubbly inside, about 15
minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle
with parsley if desired.
