Chef John’s Chicken Saltimbocca


Ingredients
2 boneless chicken breasts
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
4 to 8 sage leaves, or as needed
3 thin slices prosciutto
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons Marsala wine or white wine
1/2 lemon, juiced
1/3 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 lemon wedges (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a
solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth
side of a meat mallet to a 3/8-inch thickness. Season
lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper. With the
smoother side of chicken breasts facing up, lay 2 to 4 sage
leaves on each breast; more sage leaves will give a stronger
sage flavor. Then, cover breasts with a single layer of
prosciutto, covering the sage underneath. Lay a piece of
plastic wrap on top, and press down firmly to flatten.
Refrigerate for about 30 minutes before cooking for best
results. Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-
high heat. Place chicken, prosciutto-side down. in the pan,
and sear until prosciutto is lightly browned, about 3
minutes. Turn chicken over, and cook until chicken is no
longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 3
minutes more. Exact time will depend on size and thickness
of chicken breasts. Turn off heat, remove chicken to a
plate, and cover loosely with foil. For the sauce, add
Marsala, lemon juice, and chicken broth to the pan, along
with any accumulated juices from the plate with chicken, and
place back over medium-high heat. Boil until reduced by
half, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and swirl in
butter until it disappears. Spoon sauce generously over
chicken saltimbocca and add a lemon wedge on the side.
