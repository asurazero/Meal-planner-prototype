Boursin Chicken


Ingredients
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
⅓ cup thinly sliced shallots
1 ½ cups heavy cream
1 (5.2 ounce) package shallot and chive cheese spread (such as Boursin)
chopped fresh chives (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season with
salt and pepper. Heat butter and oil in a large nonstick
skillet until butter is melted. Add seasoned chicken thighs
and cook until nicely browned, about 5 minutes. Turn chicken
and continue cooking about 2 minutes. Sprinkle sliced
shallots over the chicken thighs, cover, and reduce heat to
low. Continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center of the thighs reaches 165 degrees F
(74 degrees C), 8 to 9 minutes more. Remove chicken to a
plate or serving platter and keep warm. Stir cream into the
pan drippings and add Boursin, breaking it into pieces.
Increase heat to medium. Stir and cook until the cheese is
melted and the sauce is bubbly, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce
over cooked chicken thighs and garnish with snipped chives,
if desired. Serve warm.
