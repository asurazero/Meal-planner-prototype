Quick Air Fryer Tilapia


Ingredients
olive oil cooking spray
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 ½ teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
¾ teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon garlic powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pound tilapia fillets, thawed if frozen
4 lemon slices

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray
the air fryer basket with olive oil spray or line with a
parchment liner. Whisk flour, seafood seasoning, paprika,
garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl.
Remove tilapia filets from the package and pat dry with a
paper towel. Lightly spray filets with olive oil, and
sprinkle flour seasoning over each filet, pressing down to
coat all of the fish. Turn them over, and season on the
other side as well. Place the filets into the air fryer
basket, without overlapping, so air can circulate around the
filets. Cook until tilapia filets flake easily with a fork,
7 to 10 minutes. There is no need to flip them. Depending on
your air fryer size, you might have to cook them in batches.
Top each filet with a slice of lemon, and serve hot.
