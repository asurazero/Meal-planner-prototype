Chef John's Parker House Rolls


Ingredients
½ cup warm milk
½ cup warm water
1 package active dry yeast
2 large eggs
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
¾ cup unsalted butter, melted, divided
4 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine warm milk, warm water, and dry yeast in the mixing
bowl of a stand mixer . Let sit for 10 minutes. Add eggs,
sugar, salt, and 1/2 cup melted butter. Whisk all wet
ingredients together. Add all purpose flour and knead with
the dough hook (or manually) until dough comes together as a
ball, 5 to 6 minutes. Place dough into a lightly buttered
bowl, cover, and let sit until the dough is doubled in size,
about 2 hours. Press the dough until it is flat, and divide
into 24 equal portions. Form each portion into a smooth
ball. Line a baking sheet with a Silpat mat or parchment
paper. Take each ball of dough and roll out on a lightly
floured surface into an oval, 4 to 5 inches long. Brush the
top with some of the remaining butter and fold in half.
Transfer the rolls to the prepared baking sheet, arranging
in 6 rows of 4 rolls. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and
let the rolls rise in a warm spot until almost doubled in
size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees C (175
degrees C). Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden
brown on top, about 25 minutes. While rolls are still warm,
brush the tops of the rolls with melted butter.
