Ingredients
1/2 pound chorizo
1/2 poblano pepper, chopped
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
2 Yukon gold potatoes,
4 large eggs
1/3 cup half-and-half
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup shredded cheese, any kind
4 burrito-sized flour tortilla

Cooking Instructions

Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add chorizo, poblano
pepper, onions, and red bell pepper. Cook until vegetables
are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. In a
microwave-safe bowl, cook potatoes with a small amount of
water until fork tender, 7 to 10 minutes, stirring halfway
through; drain. Stir potatoes into chorizo mixture.
Meanwhile, whisk eggs, half-and-half, salt, and pepper
together in a large bowl. Heat butter in a skillet over
medium heat. Add egg mixture and scramble until eggs are
cooked, about 3 minutes. Remove eggs from heat. Fold in
cheese. Spoon chorizo mixture in a line across the middle of
a tortilla, then add a layer of scrambled eggs. Fold
opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll
1 of the opposing edges around the filling creating a
burrito.
