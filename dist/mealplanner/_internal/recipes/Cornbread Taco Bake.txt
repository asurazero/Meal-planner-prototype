Cornbread Taco Bake


Ingredients
1 pound ground beef
3 tablespoons taco seasoning
1 (10 ounce) tomatoes with green chilies
1 (8.75 ounce) can corn, drained
1 (15.5 ounce) can chili beans
4 ounces heddar cheese, shredded
1 (8.5 ounce) cornbread mix
1 large egg
1/3 cup milk
sour cream

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a deep
cast iron skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no
longer pink, breaking it into crumbles, 5 to 7 minutes.
Drain off excess grease. Stir in taco seasoning, tomatoes
with green chilies, corn, and chili beans. Stir in Cheddar
cheese. Stir cornbread mix, egg, and milk together in a
bowl. Spread batter over beef mixture. Bake in the preheated
oven until a toothpick inserted near the center of cornbread
comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Garnish each serving with
sour cream and chopped green onions. Serve immediately.
