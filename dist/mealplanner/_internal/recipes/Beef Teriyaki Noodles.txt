Beef Teriyaki Noodles


Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) package vermicelli noodles
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
2 medium zucchini, diced
1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
1 large bell pepper, diced
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 pound boneless rib-eye steak, fat trimmed, cut crosswise into thin strips
½ cup soy sauce
¼ cup water
¼ cup light brown sugar
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
½ teaspoon ground ginger

Cooking Instructions

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a
rolling boil; stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook
noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is
tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and keep
warm. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick
skillet over medium-high heat; add zucchini, onion, and bell
pepper. Season lightly with salt and pepper; cook, stirring
occasionally, until vegetables are lightly caramelized and
tender, about 8 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook until
garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer vegetables into
a bowl and set aside. Heat remaining oil in the skillet
until hot. Add steak strips and sear until nicely browned on
each side and steak is cooked to medium. Season steak
lightly with salt and pepper while it cooks. Meanwhile, to
make the teriyaki sauce: combine soy sauce, water, brown
sugar, vinegar, cornstarch, and ginger in a bowl. Whisk
until sauce is well blended. Add vegetables back into the
skillet once steak is cooked and pour teriyaki sauce over
everything. Bring mixture to a simmer, and cook until the
sauce thickens up, about 2 minutes. Add cooked noodles and
gently stir to evenly coat noodles with the sauce. Taste,
and adjust the seasonings if desired.
