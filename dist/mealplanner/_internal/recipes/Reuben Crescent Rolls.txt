Reuben Crescent Rolls


Ingredients
2 (8-count) cans crescent rolls
8 thin slices pastrami or corned beef
4 slices Swiss cheese
1 cup sauerkraut
8 teaspoons thousand island salad dressing
1 large egg, beaten
2 teaspoons caraway seeds

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and line a
sheet pan with parchment paper. On a cutting board or work
surface, separate crescent rolls into 16 triangles, lining
them up so that the thin points of the triangles point away
from you. Cut each slice of pastrami or corned beef
diagonally, into 2 triangles, making 16. Cut each Swiss
cheese slice in half, then cut each half diagonally, to make
16 triangles. For each triangle of crescent dough, place a
triangle of meat and shape it to be slightly smaller than
the crescent dough. Add a triangle of Swiss cheese. Place 1
tablespoon sauerkraut along the bottom edge of each
triangle. Add 1/2 teaspoon Thousand Island salad dressing on
top of the sauerkraut. Roll the crescents away from you,
beginning at the wide end and rolling to the narrow point,
the same way a crescent roll is made, keeping the filling
ingredients inside the dough as it rolls. Place each
completed roll on the prepared pan. Brush each roll-up with
egg, and sprinkle with caraway seeds. Bake in the preheated
oven until golden brown and hot throughout, 21 to 25
minutes. Remove to cool on a baking rack for 3 to 5 minutes.
Serve warm.
