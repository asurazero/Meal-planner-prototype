Chef John's Hot Water Cornbread


Ingredients
2 cups cornmeal
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 cups water
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
3 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a
bowl and whisk thoroughly until well mixed. Pour in water,
and carefully mix with a spoon until combined. Add butter
and mix with a spoon until combined. Line a baking sheet
with parchment paper. Use a spoon or ice cream scoop to
transfer 8 equal portions onto the prepared pan. Cover with
plastic and press with your hands to form smooth patties
about 1-inch thick. For best results, chill dough in the
refrigerator for at least 1 hour before frying. If needed,
dough can be fried as soon as it is made. Heat oil in a deep
fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), or
heat oil, 1/2-inch deep in a heavy skillet to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Deep fry cornbread in the preheated deep
fryer (or pan-fry in the preheated skillet) until nicely
browned, about 3 minutes per side. Let cool about 10 minutes
before serving.
