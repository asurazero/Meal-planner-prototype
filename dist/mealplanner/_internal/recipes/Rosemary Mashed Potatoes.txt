Rosemary Mashed Potatoes


Ingredients
2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks
2/3 cup milk
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons fresh rosemary
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Cooking Instructions

Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water;
bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until
tender, 15 to 18 minutes. Drain. Meanwhile, heat milk,
butter, and rosemary in a small saucepan over low heat until
butter is melted. Set aside. Drain potatoes, and return to
the pot. Sprinkle Parmesan over the potatoes and start
mashing with a potato masher or an electric mixer. Gradually
pour in milk mixture while continuing to mash. Season with
salt and pepper to taste.
