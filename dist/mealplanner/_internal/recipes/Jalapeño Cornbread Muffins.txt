JalapeÒo Cornbread Muffins


Ingredients
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup onion
1/4 cup jalape
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon taco seasoning, or to taste
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and grease the
cups of a 12-muffin tin. Place 1/4 cup butter in a small
skillet and melt. When butter is melted, add onion and
minced jalape√±o and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5
minutes. Set aside to cool. In a mixing bowl, combine beaten
eggs and buttermilk, stirring briskly to combine. In a
separate bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, taco
seasoning, salt, and baking soda. When the onions and
jalape√±os have cooled to room temperature, combine with egg
and buttermilk mixture, stirring briskly. Add wet
ingredients to dry ingredients, stirring until dry
ingredients are just moistened and there are no lumps. Pour
batter evenly into prepared muffin cups. Place a slice of
jalape√±o on top of each muffin. Bake in the center of the
preheated oven until browned and a toothpick inserted into
the middle of the muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
If it does not come out clean, bake about 5 minutes more and
test again. Cool in the pan on a rack, about 5 minutes.
Serve warm.
