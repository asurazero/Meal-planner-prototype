Parmesan-Crusted Roasted Cabbage


Ingredients
3 ounces Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon italian seasoning
2 teaspoons garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
2 pounds head cabbage

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230
degrees C) with racks in top third and lower third
positions. Line 2 large-rimmed baking sheets with parchment
paper. Stir together Parmesan cheese, oil, Italian
seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and paprika in a small bowl
until cheese is well coated in oil mixture. Evenly spread
Parmesan mixture on one side of each cabbage wedge (about 2
tablespoons per wedge) and arrange, paste side down, on the
prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until
cabbage is tender-crisp and Parmesan creates a golden brown
crust on bottom of cabbage, 16 to 18 minutes, rotating pans
between top and bottom racks and from front to back halfway
through. Remove cabbage from oven, and let stand undisturbed
for 2 minutes, before using a spatula to release cabbage
wedges from baking sheets. Turn cabbage wedges over, cheese
side up; and bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) until
cabbage is tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve hot.
