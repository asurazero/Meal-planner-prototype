Sloppy Joe Cornbread Casserole


Ingredients
cooking spray
2 pounds ground chuck
2 cups yellow onion
1 cup green bell pepper
3 tablespoons tomato paste
2 cups beef broth
1 1/2 cups ketchup
3 tablespoons yellow mustard
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 (8.5 ounce) packages corn muffin mix (such as Jiffy
2/3 cup whole milk
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 large eggs

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Lightly spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with
cooking spray. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat;
add ground beef, and cook, stirring occasionally and
breaking up meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon,
until almost fully browned, about 4 minutes. Add onion and
bell pepper, and cook over medium-high, stirring
occasionally, until softened and tender, 6 to 8 minutes.
Stir in tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until
tomato paste has slightly darkened in color, about 2
minutes. Stir in beef broth, using a spatula to scrape any
browned bits from bottom of pan. Stir in ketchup, mustard,
Worcestershire sauce, sugar, garlic powder, and black pepper
until fully combined. Bring to a boil over medium-high, and
cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens and
bubbles appear all over the surface, about 7 minutes. Remove
from heat, and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Whisk
together corn muffin mix, milk, baking powder, and eggs in a
medium bowl until fully combined; spoon in an even layer
over sloppy Joe filling. Bake in the preheated oven until
cornbread is golden brown and a wooden pick inserted in the
center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve immediately.
