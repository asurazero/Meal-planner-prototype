Chicken Limone


Ingredients
4 4 ounce chicken breast cutlets
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons shallot
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon parsley
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 lemon, quartered, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Season chicken with salt and pepper.
Place flour in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken cutlets in
flour, shaking off excess. Place chicken on a large plate.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
chicken to skillet, and cook until golden and cooked
through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a
large plate. Add butter, shallot, and lemon zest to
drippings in skillet, and cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until shallot is softened, about 1 minute. Add
lemon juice, and cook, scraping up any browned bits from
bottom of skillet. Stir in chicken broth and parsley; cook,
stirring often, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
Remove from heat, and slowly add cream, whisking constantly
and vigorously. Return chicken to skillet, and spoon sauce
over chicken. Garnish with quartered lemon slices before
serving.
