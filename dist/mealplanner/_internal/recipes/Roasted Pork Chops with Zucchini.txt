Roasted Pork Chops with Zucchini


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup rated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning blend
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 large egg
4 zucchini, quartered lengthwise, then halved crosswise
4 boneless pork chops
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
16 cherry tomatoes (optional)
4 parsley sprigs, or as needed (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and line
a 12x18-inch sheet pan with foil. Place a baking rack on top
of the foil. In a small bowl, combine panko bread crumbs,
Parmesan cheese, Italian herb seasoning, red pepper flakes,
granulated garlic, smoked paprika, and salt and pepper to
taste. Place 2/3 of the mixture on a plate, and set aside.
Break egg into a shallow bowl and beat until the white and
yolk are incorporated. Lightly brush each zucchini piece
with egg, and toss with 1/3 of the panko crumb mixture.
Place breaded zucchini on the prepared rack. Dip chops into
beaten egg and hold over the bowl to allow excess to drip
back into the bowl. Place each chop on the reserved panko
mixture, then turn and coat the other side with panko
mixture, gently patting mixture onto each chop. Heat olive
oil and butter together in a large skillet over medium heat
until butter is melted and no longer sizzling. Carefully
place each chop into the skillet and brown each side,
turning once, 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning once. Nestle
browned chops on the prepared rack with zucchini pieces.
Roast in the preheated oven until chops are no longer pink
at the center and zucchini is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. An
instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chops
should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove chops from
the oven and place on a serving plate. If desired, broil
zucchini pieces until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. See
Cookâ€™s Note. Garnish with cherry tomatoes and fresh parsley,
and serve warm.
