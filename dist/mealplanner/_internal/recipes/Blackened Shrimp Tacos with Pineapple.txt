Blackened Shrimp Tacos with Pineapple


Ingredients
2 tablespoons smoked paprika
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 fresh pineapple
1/4 cup red onions
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1 lime, juiced
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 pound shrimp
2 tablespoons butter
6 (6 inch) flour tortillas

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat; lightly oil
the grate. Combine paprika, onion powder, oregano, cayenne
pepper, garlic salt, and black pepper in a small bowl; set
aside. Cut the pineapple lengthwise into wedges. Grill
pineapple wedges for 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Chop
pineapple and combine in a bowl with red onions, cilantro,
fresh lime juice, and salt. Thread shrimp onto skewers;
brush with melted butter, and coat with seasoning mix. Grill
shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the
meat is opaque, about 3 minutes per side. Place tortillas on
the hot grill and heat until lightly grilled, 20 to 30
seconds per side. Place shrimp on each tortilla and top with
pineapple mixture.
