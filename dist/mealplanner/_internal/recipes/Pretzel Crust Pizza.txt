Pretzel Crust Pizza


Ingredients
1 ¼ cups warm water
1 ½ tablespoons
1 (1/4-ounce) envelope active dry yeast
3 ½ cups
1 teaspoon
neutral cooking oil,
cooking spray
tablespoon
2 tablespoons hot water
2 cups part-skim mozzarella cheese
30 pepperoni slices
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
pretzel salt
1/3 cup whole milk
8 ounces processed cheese
1 tablespoon
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Prepare the pizza: Place warm water,
sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a
dough hook. Whisk until just combined, and let stand until
foamy, about 5 minutes. Add flour and salt; mix on low speed
until just combined, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to
medium, and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5
minutes. Shape dough into a ball, and transfer to a large
greased bowl, rotating dough to coat all sides in oil. Cover
with plastic wrap or a clean damp towel; let rest in a warm
area until doubled in size, 25 to 30 minutes. Preheat the
oven to 425 degrees F (230 degrees C) with a pizza stone or
overturned large rimmed baking sheet on the center rack.
Grease a large 15-inch pizza pan with cooking spray. Punch
down dough, and transfer to the prepared pizza pan. Using
clean hands, press dough to the outer edge of the pan (dough
should be 15 inches in diameter). Fold 1 to 1 1/2-inches of
dough’s outer edge over itself to create adefined crust
(dough should be 13 inches in diameter to the outer edge).
Combine baking soda and hot water in a small bowl. Using a
pastry brush, brush the top and outer edges of crust;
discard any remaining baking soda mixture. Bake crust on
pizza stone in preheated oven until crust is golden brown,
about 8 minutes. Meanwhile prepare the cheese sauce: Bring
milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium. Reduce
heat to low; add processed cheese, in batches, whisking
constantly until melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk in butter,
onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, and salt until smooth.
Set aside until ready to use. Spread cheese sauce evenly
over par-baked crust. Sprinkle with an even layer of
mozzarella cheese, and top evenly with pepperoni slices.
Brush outer crust with melted butter, and sprinkle evenly
with pretzel salt. Bake in the preheated oven at 425 degrees
F (230 degrees C) until mozzarella is slightly browned and
melted and crust is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove
from oven, and let cool on pizza pan for 5 minutes. Slice
and serve.
