Breakfast Burrito Bowl


Ingredients
4 slices center-cut bacon
cooking spray
2 (8-inch) flour tortillas
4 large eggs
1/2 cup pepper Jack cheese
3/4 teaspoon adobo seasoning
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup cherry tomatoes
1/4 cup fresh cilantro
2 scallions scallions
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 avocado avocado

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees
F (200 degrees C) for 10 minutes, or according to
manufacturer's instructions. Line the air fryer basket with
aluminum foil. Add bacon slices in a single layer and cook
until crispy, about 8 minutes. Remove from the air fryer and
set aside on a paper towel-lined plate. Reduce temperature
to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 2 large ramekins or
heatproof bowls with cooking spray, and press one tortilla
inside each bowl with the edges coming up and out. Crack 2
eggs into each tortilla shell, then top each with 1/4 cup
cheese. Sprinkle each with 1/8 teaspoon adobo seasoning and
1/8 teaspoon salt. Working with one tortilla bowl at a time,
cook in the air fryer until tortillas are crispy, egg whites
are set, and yolks are runny, 13 to 15 minutes. While
tortillas cook, stir together cherry tomatoes, cilantro,
scallions, lime juice, remaining 1/2 teaspoon adobo
seasoning, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl.
Break bacon into small pieces, and set aside. Remove
tortillas from bowls and place on a plate. Top bowls evenly
with tomato mixture, avocado, and bacon.
