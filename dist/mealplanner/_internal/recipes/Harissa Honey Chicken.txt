Harissa Honey Chicken


Ingredients
4 large chicken thighs
3 tablespoons harissa paste
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1 green onion, thinly sliced

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir
harissa paste, honey, olive oil, minced garlic, cumin,
coriander, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Rub the
mixture over each chicken thigh and under the skin, ensuring
each thigh is coated evenly. Place chicken thighs skin-side
up in a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the
chicken is cooked through and the skin is browned and
caramelized, 35 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should
read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with green
onions.
