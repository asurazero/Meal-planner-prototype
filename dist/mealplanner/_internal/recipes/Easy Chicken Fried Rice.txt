Easy Chicken Fried Rice


Ingredients
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil
⅓ cup diced carrots
¼ cup sliced green onions, white and lighter green parts
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon ground ginger
3 cups cold cooked rice
1 teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup shredded cooked chicken
½ cup frozen peas
2 tablespoons butter
2 large eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons Sriracha mayonnaise, or to taste
1 tablespoon sliced green onions, or to taste

Cooking Instructions

Heat canola and sesame oils in a large, nonstick skillet
over medium-high heat. Add carrot and 1/4 cup green onion;
cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Stir in garlic
powder and ginger and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in rice,
salt, and pepper; cook, stirring only once or twice, until
rice is lightly browned, about 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in
chicken and peas; cook for 2 minutes. Push rice mixture to
the sides of the pan, creating a circle in the middle. Add
butter to the center of the pan. When melted, pour eggs into
the center. Cook eggs, stirring often, until almost set,
about 3 minutes. Stir eggs into the rice mixture. Stir in
soy sauce and rice vinegar; cook for 2 more minutes. Serve
immediately topped with Sriracha mayo and green onions.
