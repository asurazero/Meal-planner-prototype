Loaded Waffle Fries


Ingredients
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
1 teaspoon dill pickle relish
12 ounces waffle fries
2 slices thick cut bacon
8 ounces lean ground beef
1/2 teaspoon Seasoning)
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded lettuce
1 Roma tomato, chopped
2 tablespoons red onion

Cooking Instructions

Whisk ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, and dill pickle relish
in a small bowl. Set sauce aside. Preheat the oven to 425
degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil,
and arrange waffle fries on the sheet in a single layer.
Bake fries in the preheated oven until golden, about 20
minutes, or according to package directions. Meanwhile,
place bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook
until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper
towel-lined plate. Crumble when cool enough to handle. Heat
the same skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble beef into
the skillet, sprinkle with Worcestershire pub burger
seasoning, and cook and stir until browned, about 8 minutes.
Drain in a colander. Divide beef among the cooked fries and
top with cheese. Return baking sheet to the oven and bake
until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Top fries with
lettuce, tomato, onion, and bacon. Drizzle reserved sauce
over the top and serve immediately.
