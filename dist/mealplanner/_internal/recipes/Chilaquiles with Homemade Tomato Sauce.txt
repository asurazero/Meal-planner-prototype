Chilaquiles with Homemade Tomato Sauce


Ingredients
16 corn tortillas
2 cups oil, or as needed for frying
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
2 cups water
2 chiles, stems and seeds removed
1 white onion, quartered
3 cloves garlic
4 tomatoes, quartered
2 jalapenos, halved
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 (14.5 ounce) fire-roasted diced tomatoes
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 large eggs
1/2 cup queso fresco
1 avocado, sliced
1/4 cup crema
sliced radish, hot sauce, chopped cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Cut each tortilla into 8 wedges. Heat oil to 350 degrees F
(180 degrees C) in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add
tortillas to fry in batches, taking care not to crowd the
pot. Cook, stirring constantly until golden and crispy, 1 to
2 minutes. Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and drain
well on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt to taste
immediately. Repeat with remaining tortillas. In a large
saucepan, add water and guajillo chiles. Bring mixture to a
boil over high heat, reduce temperature, and simmer until
chiles soften, about 5 minutes. Return heat to medium-high
and add onion, garlic, tomatoes, jalapenos, cumin, and 1
teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion has
softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully
pour mixture into a blender or food processor. Add canned
tomatoes, vinegar, and olive oil. Remove center from the lid
to allow steam to escape and blend until smooth, about 1
minute, scraping down the sides as necessary. In a large
skillet over medium heat, add 1 cup of sauce and bring to a
simmer, stirring often. Add 1/4 of the chips and cook about
3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the chips are well-
coated in sauce and fully heated through. Place chips on a
plate. In a separate small skillet, heat 1/2 tablespoon
butter over medium heat. Crack an egg into the butter and
cook over easy or as desired. Add egg to chips and top with
queso fresco, avocado, crema, and any other desired
toppings.
