Perfect Grilled Ribeye


Ingredients
1/2 lime , juiced
2 teaspoons seasoning
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (8 ounce) ribeye steak

Cooking Instructions

Combine lime juice, carne asada seasoning, and oil in a
resealable plastic bag. Add ribeye steak, reseal the bag,
and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 45 minutes. Drain
marinade and allow steak to come to room temperature, about
30 minutes. Blot any excess moisture off the steak. Preheat
the grill to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C), and lightly oil
the grate. Place steak on the grill over direct heat. For
rare: cook steaks until browned on the outside and red in
the center, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees
F (52 degrees C). Remove steak from grill; rest 5 minutes
before serving.
