Mini Lemon Tarts


Ingredients
1 cup white sugar
⅓ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
3 large eggs
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon lemon zest
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
½ cup white sugar
½ teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). To make
the filling: Combine sugar, lemon juice, eggs, flour, and
lemon zest together in a large mixing bowl, and whisk until
well blended. Set aside. To make the crust: Combine flour,
butter, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor;
pulse several times until dough begins to come together in a
ball. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions: press each
portion of dough into the bottom and up the sides of
nonstick 6-cup mini tart pan. Spoon lemon filling into each
crust. Bake tarts in the preheated oven until the filling is
set and the crust is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool
on a wire rack until mini tarts reach room temperature.
