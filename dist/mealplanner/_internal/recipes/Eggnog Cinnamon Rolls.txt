Eggnog Cinnamon Rolls


Ingredients
⅓ cup granulated sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package quick-rising yeast (such as Fleischmann's RapidRise®)
2 teaspoons kosher salt
4 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided, or more as needed
½ cup eggnog
½ cup sour cream
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1 large egg, lightly beaten
cooking spray
½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons freshly grated nutmeg, or to taste
4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 ½ cups powdered sugar
4 tablespoons eggnog
½ teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Combine sugar, yeast, salt, and 4
cups of the flour in the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted
with the paddle attachment. Beat on low speed until just
combined, about 15 seconds. With mixer running on low speed,
add eggnog, sour cream, butter, and egg. Continue beating
until dough forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Switch to a dough hook
attachment. Beat on medium-low speed until dough is smooth
and elastic, 6 to 9 minutes; gradually add remaining 1/2 cup
flour, 1/2 to 1 teaspoon at a time, if necessary. Place
dough in a large bowl greased with cooking spray and turn to
coat. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a
warm draft-free place until dough has doubled in size, 2 to
3 hours. Spray a 13- x 9-inch pan with cooking spray.
Lightly punch down dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll
dough into an 18- x 10-inch rectangle. For the filling
spread 1/2 cup of butter over the dough. In a small bowl,
stir together brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Sprinkle
evenly over butter. Starting with one long side, roll dough
into a log; pinch seam to seal. Slice into 12 rolls. Place
rolls in the prepared pan. Cover, and let rise in a warm
draft-free place until doubled in size, 1 hour to 1 hour and
15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
C). Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until golden
brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack 15
minutes. Add cream cheese and 4 tablespoons butter to the
bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment;
beat on medium speed until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add
powdered sugar, eggnog, and vanilla. Beat on medium speed
until smooth, about 1 minute. Drizzle glaze over warm rolls.
Serve with freshly grated nutmeg sprinkled on top and any
extra glaze, if desired.
