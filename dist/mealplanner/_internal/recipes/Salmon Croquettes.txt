Salmon Croquettes


Ingredients
1 pound boneless, skinless salmon fillets
½ cup baking mix (such as Bisquick)
½ cup diced onion
¼ cup diced red bell pepper
¼ cup freshly chopped parsley
1 large egg
3 cloves garlic, minced
½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
¼ teaspoon seasoned salt
¼ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay)
⅓ cup cornmeal
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Cooking Instructions

Finely chop the salmon using a food processor. Transfer
salmon to a bowl. Add baking mix, onion, bell pepper,
parsley, egg, garlic, Worcestershire, seasoned salt, and
seafood seasoning; mix well until well combined. Form the
mixture into 8 small patties, and place onto a plate lined
with waxed paper. Refrigerate the patties for 15 minutes.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place
cornmeal into a shallow dish and dredge each patty in
cornmeal, pressing lightly so that the cornmeal adheres to
both sides of the patties. Cook patties in the oil until
golden and cooked through, working in batches, about 3 to 4
minutes per side.
