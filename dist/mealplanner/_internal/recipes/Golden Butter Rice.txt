Golden Butter Rice


Ingredients
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 tablespoon fresh ginger
1 1/4 teaspoons ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups basmati rice or other long grain white rice
3 cups water
1/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/3 cup sliced green onions (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Melt butter in a pan or pot with a tight-fitting lid over
medium heat. As soon as butter starts to bubble, add in
ginger, turmeric, cayenne, brown sugar, and salt. Cook,
whisking, for 1 minute. Add rice, and stir until every grain
is coated with butter. Stir in water, and bring to a boil
over high heat. As soon as it begins to boil, gently shake
and swirl the pan to settle rice into an even layer, then
reduce heat to medium-low. Cover tightly and simmer for 15
minutes. Turn off heat, and let rest, covered, for 10
minutes. DO NOT lift the lid or try to stir yet. Now, remove
the lid and use a fork to fluff and separate rice grains.
Season to taste, and serve immediately, garnished with
walnuts and green onions.
