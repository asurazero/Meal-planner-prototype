Grilled Marinated Swordfish


Ingredients
⅓ cup white wine
¼ cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon poultry seasoning
¼ teaspoon salt
⅛ teaspoon pepper
4 swordfish steaks
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (Optional)
4 slices lemon, for garnish (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

To make the marinade: Mix wine, lemon juice, soy sauce,
olive oil, garlic, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper in a
glass baking dish until combined. Lay swordfish steaks in
marinade; turn to coat. Refrigerate for 1 hour, turning
frequently. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and
lightly oil the grate. Cook swordfish steaks on the
preheated grill until cooked through and the fish flakes
easily with a fork, 5 to 6 minutes per side; discard
marinade. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center of each steak should read at least 145 degrees F (63
degrees C). Garnish swordfish steaks with parsley and serve
with lemon wedges.
