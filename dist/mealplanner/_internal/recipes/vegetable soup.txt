vegetable soup


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Crumble ground beef into a stockpot over medium-high heat;
cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no
longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess
grease. Stir in carrots, celery, and onion; cook and stir
until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in
potatoes, corn, green beans, undrained peas, tomato sauce,
and crushed whole tomatoes. Season with black pepper; add
bay leaf and thyme. Pour in 1/4 cup water if needed,
replenishing as needed while cooking. Bring soup to a
simmer; cover and cook, stirring regularly, until potatoes
are tender, about 1 hour. Serve hot and enjoy!
