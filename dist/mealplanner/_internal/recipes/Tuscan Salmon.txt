Tuscan Salmon


Ingredients
4 (5 ounce) salmon filets
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 or 3 short rosemary sprigs, plus more for garnish
1/3 cup prosciutto
1 green onion, finely chopped
1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
1/2 lemon, zested
1/2 cup white wine
1 cup cherry tomato halves
1 (10 ounce) package fresh spinach, torn
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 olive oil for drizzling, or as needed
lemon slices
pine nuts (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Pat salmon filets dry with paper towels and season both
sides with salt and pepper. Melt butter in a large skillet
over medium heat; add olive oil. When butter stops sizzling,
swirl the skillet to combine. Add 2 or 3 rosemary sprigs to
the skillet, to flavor the oil. Add salmon and cook until
salmon is lightly browned and flakes when a fork is gently
inserted, about 3 minutes per side. (If salmon filets are
thinner than 1 1/2 inches, this may take less time.) An
instant read thermometer, inserted near the center, should
read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from the skillet,
and keep warm. To the same skillet with rosemary, add
chopped prosciutto, green onion, garlic, red pepper flakes,
and lemon zest, and cook for 1 minute or until fragrant. Add
white wine and cook until the liquid evaporates. Add
tomatoes and cook, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes. Add spinach and
toss in the skillet until bright green and barely wilted, 2
to 3 minutes. Stir in cream, and season with salt and
pepper. Cook until sauce bubbles, about 2 minutes, and
remove cooked rosemary sprigs. Serve salmon on a bed of
vegetables and sauce, and drizzle with a little olive oil.
Garnish with lemon slices, fresh rosemary sprigs, and
toasted pine nuts, if desired.
