Skillet-Roasted Radishes with Mint Gremolata


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound radishes, halved, or quartered if large
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more for garnish
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh mint
1 tablespoon fresh parsley
1 teaspoon lemon zest
salt, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Heat oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
radishes, cut sides down, salt, and pepper. Cook until cut
sides begin to blister, about 5 minutes. Add water; reduce
heat to medium. Cook, covered, until radishes are tender, 3
to 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Add lemon juice. In a small
bowl, stir together garlic, mint, parsley, and lemon zest.
Sprinkle over radishes. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt.
