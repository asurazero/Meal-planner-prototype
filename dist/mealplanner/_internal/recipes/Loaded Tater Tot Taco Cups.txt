Loaded Tater Tot Taco Cups


Ingredients
cooking spray
16 ounces frozen bite-sized potato nuggets Tater Tots
8 ounces lean ground beef
1/2 ounce taco seasoning
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup shredded lettuce
1/4 cup salsa
1/4 cup sour cream

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray 12
cups of a standard muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray.
Place 5 tater tots in each of the 12 slots. Bake tots in the
preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove the muffin pan from
the oven. Use a tamper or the bottom of a small glass to
press the tater tots down into the bottom and sides of each
cup. This will create a tater tot cup. Place back in the
oven and cook 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, heat a large
skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef
with taco seasoning in the hot skillet until browned and
crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Divide
ground beef between the cups. Top with shredded cheese.
Return the muffin pan to the oven and bake until cheese is
melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven to a rack to
cool for 3 minutes. Top with lettuce, salsa, and sour cream.
Serve immediately.
