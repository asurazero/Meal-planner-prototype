Salted Caramel Banana Ritz Icebox Cake


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups whole milk
5.1 ounce vanilla instant pudding
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup confectionersâ€™ sugar
14 ounce sweetened condensed milk
8 ounce sour cream
1/4 cup salted caramel sauce
1 buttery crackers
6 cups thinly sliced spotted bananas
sea salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Whisk together milk and pudding and
pie filling in a large bowl until mostly smooth. Let stand
until very thick, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, beat vanilla
and 2 1/2 cups of the heavy whipping cream in a large bowl
with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form,
about 2 minutes. Gradually add confectioners' sugar, and
beat until stiff peaks form, 15 to 30 seconds. Whisk
sweetened condensed milk and sour cream into thickened
pudding until smooth. Fold in whipped cream until smooth and
light. Microwave 1/4 cup salted caramel and remaining 2
tablespoons heavy whipping cream in a small microwave-safe
bowl on high until loosened, about 10 seconds; whisk to
combine. Place 32 of the crackers in an even layer in the
bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking up crackers as
needed to fill space. Spread 3 cups of the pudding mixture
in an even layer over crackers. Top pudding mixture with 2
cups of the sliced bananas. Drizzle evenly with about 2
tablespoons of the salted caramel mixture. Repeat layering
process once more, ending with a layer of salted caramel.
Evenly top with remaining 34 crackers, breaking them as
needed to fit. Spread remaining 3 cups pudding mixture over
crackers. Store, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 8
hours or up to overnight. Before serving, top with remaining
2 cups sliced bananas. Drizzle with salted caramel sauce and
sprinkle flaky sea salt. Cut into slices and serve drizzled
with extra caramel sauce if desired.
