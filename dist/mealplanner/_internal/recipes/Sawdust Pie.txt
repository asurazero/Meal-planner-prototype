Sawdust Pie


Ingredients
1/2 (14.1-ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts
7 large egg whites
1 1/2 cups flaked coconut
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
whipped cream for serving
bananas for serving

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate; fold
edges over, and crimp with the tines of a fork. Poke holes
evenly along the sides and bottom of pie crust with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until pie crust is dry to the
touch on the bottom and sides, about 8 minutes. Remove from
oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Gently fold together egg
whites, flaked coconut, graham cracker crumbs, walnuts,
sugar, salt, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until fully
combined and a thick mixture forms, about 1 minute. Transfer
egg white mixture to prepared pie crust and gently spread it
into an even layer. Return to the oven and bake at 350
degrees F (175 degrees C) until pie crust edges are golden
brown and the center is set, about 25 minutes. Remove from
oven and let cool completely on a wire rack, about 1 hour.
Slice and top with whipped cream and sliced bananas.
