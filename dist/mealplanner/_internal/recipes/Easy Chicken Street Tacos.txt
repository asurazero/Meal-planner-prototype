Easy Chicken Street Tacos


Ingredients
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken
1 onion, diced
1/2 cup cilantro
8 corn tortillas

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly
oil the grate. Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until
juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink at the
center, about 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer,
inserted near the center, should read at least 165 degrees F
(74 degrees C). Heat corn tortillas until soft and pliable
in the microwave, about 1 minute. Top with chicken, onions,
and cilantro.
