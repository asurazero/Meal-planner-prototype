One Pot Creamy Ground Beef and Orzo


Ingredients
1 tablespoon oil
10 ounces lean ground beef
1 small onion
3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup orzo
3 cups marinara sauce
1/2 cup water
1 cup half-and-half, divided
3 tablespoons mascarpone cheese
3/4 cup fontina cheese
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Heat oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat until
hot, about 3 minutes. Add ground beef; cook and stir,
breaking up clumps with a spatula, for a few minutes. Stir
in onion, garlic, and Italian seasoning. Continue to cook
and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 8 minutes
total. Sprinkle orzo pasta on top of mixture. Stir in
marinara sauce, water, and 1/2 cup half-and-half. Cover;
reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a low simmer for 15
minutes. Remove lid, stir in remaining 1/2 cup half-and-half
and mascarpone. Spread mixture out in the skillet, and top
with shredded fontina and Parmesan. Preheat the ovenâ€™s
broiler, and place a rack about 6 inches from the heat
source. Broil until cheese is golden and melted, about 3
minutes.
