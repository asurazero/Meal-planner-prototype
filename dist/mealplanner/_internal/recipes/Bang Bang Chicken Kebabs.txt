Bang Bang Chicken Kebabs


Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken breast
3/4 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons riracha,
1 red bell pepper
1 green bell pepper
1 onion
8 mushrooms
1/3 cup chili sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons oil
2 green onions
1 lime

Cooking Instructions

Combine chicken breast pieces, buttermilk, and 2 tablespoons
sriracha in a bowl. Stir to combine, and let stand at room
temperature while the grill heats. Preheat an outdoor grill
for medium heat. Thread chicken pieces, bell pepper wedges,
onion wedges, and mushrooms onto metal skewers, alternating
and evenly dividing the chicken and vegetables. For bang
bang sauce, stir remaining sriracha, sweet Thai chili sauce,
soy sauce, mayonnaise, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt
together in a small bowl. Reserve 1/2 of the sauce for
serving. When the grill is hot, pour cooking oil on a folded
paper towel, and use tongs to oil the hot grill grates.
Place skewers on the oiled grates, brush skewers with sauce,
close the grill lid and grill 2 to 3 minutes. Turn skewers a
quarter turn, brush with sauce, close the lid and grill 2 to
3 minutes. Repeat until all sides are lightly charred,
chicken is no longer pink at the center, and juices run
clear, 4 to 8 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer
inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74
degrees C). Remove skewers from the grill to a serving
platter, tent with foil, and allow to rest for 5 to 10
minutes. Garnish with thinly sliced green onion and lime
wedges. Serve with reserved sauce.
