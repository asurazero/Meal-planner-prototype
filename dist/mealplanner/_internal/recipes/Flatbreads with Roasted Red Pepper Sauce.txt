Flatbreads with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce


Ingredients
4 large red bell peppers
1/3 cup slivered almonds, toasted
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, plus leaves for garnish
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, smashed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 14.1 ounce) package flatbreads
2 cups shredded fontina cheese
1 cup shredded cooked chicken
1/2 cup kalamata and/or green olives
black pepper, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line 2
(10x15-inch) rimmed baking sheets with foil. Arrange half of
the peppers, cut sides down, on each prepared baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until skin is blistered and
charred, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer peppers to a large bowl.
Cover with plastic wrap or a tea towel; let stand until cool
enough to handle, 20 to 30 minutes. Peel and discard skins.
You should have about 2 cups roasted peppers. Reduce oven
temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). For sauce,
blend roasted peppers, almonds, oil, chopped basil, lemon
juice, garlic, and salt in a blender or food processor until
smooth. Remove and discard foil from baking sheets. Arrange
1 flatbread on each baking sheet. Spread each flatbread with
1/2 cup sauce, spreading to 1/2 inch from edges. Reserve
remaining sauce for another use. Top evenly with cheese,
chicken, and olives. Bake until cheese is melted and edges
are browned, 8 to 9 minutes. For a crispier crust, bake
topped flatbreads 6 to 7 minutes directly on oven rack
instead of on baking sheets. Garnish with black pepper and
additional basil. Cut each flatbread into 6 slices.
