Chocolate Chipless Cookies


Ingredients
3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup coconut oil
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon flaky sea salt for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Add butter to a small saucepan set over medium heat and
cook,stirring constantly, until butter begins to lightly
foam and turns from light yellow to golden brown, about 5
minutes. When the butter begins to brown, turn off heat and
set aside to cool. Combine room temperature browned butter,
brown sugar, and granulated sugar in a bowl and beat with an
electric mixer until well combined. Add egg, egg yolk, and
vanilla extract and mix until thoroughly combined. In a
separate bowl, combine flour, salt, and baking soda.
Gradually add flour mixture to the butter mixture, 1
tablespoon at a time, until well combined. Refrigerate for
at least 1 hour, or overnight, until chilled. Preheat the
oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and line a sheet with
parchment paper. Measure out 1-inch portions of the batter
with a spoon or use an ice cream scoop to cut out balls.
Place dough balls them on the prepared baking sheet roughly
2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges
are begin to turn just golden brown, 11 to 12 minutes. Set
aside to cool. While the cookies cool, prepare the chocolate
shell. Add coconut oil to a small bowl and melt in the
microwave for 30 seconds. Add chocolate chips and stir until
chocolate has thoroughly melted. Set aside. Once cookies are
cooled completely, dip each cookie into the melted chocolate
to coat half of the cookie. Set on a clean baking sheet or
wax paper to harden (it will happen almost instantly).
Garnish with flaky sea salt and enjoy!
