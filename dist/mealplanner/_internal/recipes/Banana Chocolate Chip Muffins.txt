Banana Chocolate Chip Muffins


Ingredients
1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
¾ cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
½ cup vegetable oil
½ cup plain yogurt
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
¾ cup semisweet chocolate chips

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. Combine
flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a
large bowl. Mix oil, yogurt, egg, and vanilla together in a
separate bowl until well combined; stir into flour mixture
until smooth. Gently fold in mashed bananas and chocolate
chips. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling
each 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring
back when lightly pressed, about 22 to 25 minutes. Cool
briefly in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool
completely.
