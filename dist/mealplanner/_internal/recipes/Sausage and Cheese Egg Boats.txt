Sausage and Cheese Egg Boats


Ingredients
1 pound breakfast sausage
1 loaf Cuban bread, French loaf
2 cups shredded Cheddar
6 large eggs
1/3 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/3 cup red bell pepper
1/4 cup green onion

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a
rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Heat a large skillet
over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot
skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain any
excess grease; set aside to cool slightly. Using a serrated
knife, trim off the top layer of bread to expose the inside.
Create a well for the fillings by removing most of the bread
on the inside. Place 3/4 cup cheese along the bottom of the
bread; place bread on the prepared baking sheet. Whisk eggs,
cream, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until well
blended. Stir in cooked sausage, bell pepper, green onions,
and remaining cheese; pour mixture into prepared bread loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, 35 to 40
minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
