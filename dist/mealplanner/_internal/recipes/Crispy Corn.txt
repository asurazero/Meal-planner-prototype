Crispy Corn


Ingredients
3 cups oil for frying
2 (15 ounce) cans sweet corn,
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
lime wedges

Heat oil in a medium saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees

towels and pat dry, Toss corn with cornstarch until lightly
coated. Work in batches, about 1/2 cup at a time. Shake off
excess cornstarch and carefully lower corn into hot oil,

juice over and sprinkle with jalapenos if desired.
