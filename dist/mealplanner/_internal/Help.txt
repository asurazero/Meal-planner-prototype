This is the help section for beta Meal Planner app

The VIEW MEALPLAN button will naturally let you view
generated meal plans you have made using the app
note that these cannot be printed from the app itself *yet
but may be printed from the file system just by accessing the folder
and the desired meal plan by file name
MP1.text represents meal plan one and so on
feel free to print them as needed and they will be formatted
just the same as they are viewed in app

The GENERATE button will be how you generate your meal plans
there are many options here you can use to adjust the desired
mealplan parameters.  You may even add your own scheduled meals
that will be saved to the day of the week you choose
there is only the option to add two of these days because
if you needed to format your whole week for meals that
you know are scheduled then why use this app at all?
**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR GENERATION**
DO NOT EXCEED 1 ENTREE AND 3 SIDES WHEN
USING GENERATION IT WILL CRASH THE PROGRAM UNTIL
I HAVE MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS, ADDITIONALLY YOU MAY
ONLY GENERATE MEAL PLANS UP TO ABOUT 30 DAYS SUCCESSFULLY
THIS IS BY DESIGN AND IF YOU REQUIRE ADDITIONAL MEAL
PLANNING, WELL YOU HAVE FIVE SAVE SLOTS DON'T YOU?

The ADD MEAL ITEM button of course will allow you to add
meal items of your choice to the category of your choice
these will be saved accordingly and will stay in the database
along with any others you decide to add

ADD ITEMS FROM INTERNET button
this will automatically pull items from the internet based
on your selection, it can only pull new items as long as the
website it pulls from has new items to pull, it currently
has around 100ish recipes available to things like entrees
at a given time, if you want more it updates periodically
so try again at a later time

TOOLS button
this is where you access your extra tools from the app
things like managing recipes and other useful extras
