Balsamic Braised Pork Tenderloins with Fresh Figs


Ingredients
2 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloins
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 shallots, thinly sliced lengthwise
12 fresh figs, stemmed and halved
1 cup chicken broth
¼ cup good-quality balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
fresh rosemary sprigs for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pat
tenderloins dry and remove silver skin, if present. Season
with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste. Pour
oil into a large, oven-proof skillet and heat over medium-
heat until oil shimmers. Carefully place seasoned
tenderloins into the hot oil and brown on all sides, 7 to 10
minutes total. Add sliced shallots around tenderloins and
stir, about 1 minute. Add figs, chicken broth, and balsamic
vinegar. When the mixture begins to bubble, sprinkle minced
rosemary over everthing. Cover, place in the preheated oven
and bake until pork is no longer pink in the center, 25 to
30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Using
tongs, remove pork from the skillet and place on a serving
platter. With a slotted spoon, remove figs from the skillet
and place around the tenderloins. Cover loosely with foil.
Place skillet back onto the stovetop over medium-high heat.
Bring pan juices to a boil and allow to reduce to about 3/4
cup, 10 to 15 minutes. Slice tenderloins, drizzle reduced
liquid over the meat, and garnish with fresh rosemary
sprigs, if desired.

Bihari Kabab


Ingredients
1 1/4 pounds tenderloin,
1/4 cup avocado oil
1/2 onion, thinly sliced
1 kiwi, peeled and quartered
1 1/2 tablespoons gram flour
1/2 tablespoon poppy seeds
1 tablespoon garlic paste
1 tablespoon ginger paste
1 small serrano chile pepper
1/4 cup mustard oil
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1/4 cup plain full fat yogurt
1/2 nutmeg seed
1 tablespoon mace
5 star anise pods
5 whole dried red Kashmiri chilies
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt

Cooking Instructions

Pound tenderloin strips with a meat mallet until they are
very thin; set aside. Heat avocado oil in a frying pan over
medium heat. Fry onion in the hot oil until it is a deep
brown, about 5 minutes. Strain browned onion into a small
bowl using a slotted spoon, and set aside to use later. Peel
kiwi, cut into quarters, and set aside in a small bowl for
later. Heat a small non-stick skillet over medium heat, and
toast gram flour until lightly browned and nutty, 2 to 4
minutes; transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Dry-roast
poppy seeds in the same skillet until lightly brown and
aromatic, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove to a small bowl; set aside.
In the same skillet, dry-roast nutmeg, mace, star anise, and
Kashmiri chilies together until fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes.
Transfer the whole spices and chilies to a spice grinder,
and grind them to a coarse powder. Add browned onions, kiwi,
ginger paste, garlic paste, and serrano chile to the bowl of
a food processor, and grind to a paste, about 30 seconds.
Pour in mustard oil, white vinegar, and yogurt and pulse the
food processor until everything is well blended, about 15
seconds. Last of all, add roasted poppy seeds, roasted gram
flour, roasted ground whole spices, chili powder, cumin,
garam masala, black pepper, and salt to the food processor;
process marinade for 1 minute. Spoon marinade into a
resealable plastic bag and add tenderized beef strips. Seal
bag and squeeze gently to coat beef on all sides with
marinade. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, but ideally
overnight. Remove marinated beef from the refrigerator;
thread beef strips on sturdy metal skewers, packing them in
tightly. Reserve any leftover marinade to baste the kababs
with as they cook. This prevents them from drying out.
Preheat an outdoor grill to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C)
and lightly oil the grate. Grill kababs on the preheated
grill, uncovered, for 5 minutes per side. Reduce grill
temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), cover the
grill, and cook kababs for 10 minutes. Turn kebabs, brush
with marinade, and continue cooking until the internal
temperature of the meat reaches 170 degrees F (77 degrees
C), about 10 minutes more. If kababs look a bit dry at any
point in the cooking process, brush both sides with a little
bit of avocado oil. Remove skewers to a serving dish.
Discard any uncooked marinade. Enjoy the kababs with naan,
sliced red onions, tamarind chutney, and green chutney.

Champagne Chicken


Ingredients
4 boneless chicken breasts
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
2 tablespoons olive oil
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup shallots
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups champagne
1/2 teaspoon tomato paste
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Season chicken with salt on both sides. Heat olive oil over
high heat in a nonstick pan large enough to hold the chicken
breasts in a single layer, and cook chicken on both sides
until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. While the
first side is browning, season tops of breasts with black
pepper and cayenne to taste. Once both sides are browned,
turn off heat, and transfer chicken to a plate, and reserve.
Chicken can be transferred into the refrigerator until
needed. Melt butter in the pan over medium-high heat, then
add mushrooms and a pinch of salt to the pan cook, stirring
occasionally, until the mushrooms begin to brown. Stir in
shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, until shallots turn
translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle in flour and cook,
stirring, until the flour disappears and starts sticking to
the bottom of the pan, about 1 minute. Pour in champagne and
use a spatula to scrape any caramelization off the bottom of
the pan. Let mixture simmer until the champagne has reduced
by about half, and has thickened enough that the trail left
by a spatula dragged across the bottom of the pan takes a
few seconds to fill in, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in tomato
paste, fresh thyme, and chicken broth, and wait for the
sauce to return to a simmer. Stir in cream, and let the
sauce cook until reduced and thickened enough to coat a
spoon, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stir in
balsamic vinegar, and return reserved chicken to the pan.
Finish cooking the chicken by simmering gently in the sauce,
turning over and basting every few minutes, until an
instant-read thermometer inserted near the center maintains
a temperature of 150 degrees F (66 degrees C) for 3 to 4
minutes. The time it will take to complete cooking the
chicken breasts will vary, but internal temperature is a
sure guide to doneness. Taste for seasoning, and serve
chicken immediately with sauce spooned over the top.

Ingredients
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 lemon, juiced
2/3 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup green onions
1 tablespoon butter, cubed

remaining spice mixture to the pan and stir around in the
hot oil for 30 seconds. Add lemon juice, cream, and water.
Stir in a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high
heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce to medium-low and return
chicken to the pan along with any accumulated juices. Simmer
gently, turning occasionally to coat with sauce, until
chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run
clear, 8 to 10 minutes. Time will vary based on size of
chicken breasts. An instant-read thermometer inserted near
the center will read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Reduce
heat to low and add green onions and butter. Stir into the
sauce, while also basting chicken with the sauce. Taste for
seasoning and serve.

Creamy Garlic Parmesan Chicken


Ingredients
2 pounds chicken breast tenders
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
½ cup all-purpose flour
2 large eggs, beaten
1 ½ cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
parchment paper
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, or more as needed
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
3 cloves garlic, minced
½ cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
2 cups heavy cream
chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Pat chicken tenders dry with paper towels and season lightly
with salt and pepper. Place flour on a shallow plate. Place
beaten eggs into a shallow bowl. Combine grated Parmesan
cheese, Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, and 1 teaspoon smoked
paprika, and place on a second shallow plate. Cover a dinner
plate or platter with parchment paper. Dip each lightly
seasoned chicken breast tender in flour, shaking off the
excess. Next, dip in beaten egg, and hold the tender over
the eggs to allow excess to drip back into the bowl. Place
each tender on the panko mixture. With dry fingers, scoop
panko mix over the tender, patting the crumbs in. Place on
the parchment-covered plate. Repeat with remaining chicken
tenders, until all tenders are breaded with flour, egg, and
panko mix. Melt 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive
oil in a large skillet over medium heat until butter is
bubbling. Add tenders, 1 at a time, being careful not to
crowd the skillet. You may need to cook chicken in 2
batches. Cook until breading is browned and chicken is no
longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 4
minutes per side, being careful not to burn the breading.
Turn tenders when the crust is nicely browned and continue
cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Adjust heat down a notch or two, if the crust is getting too
brown, and add a bit more oil or butter, if the skillet
looks dry. Remove cooked chicken to a cooling rack. Add
garlic to the skillet, and stir until garlic is fragrant, 30
to 45 seconds. Deglaze skillet with white wine, stirring up
all the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Season
Italian herb seasoning blend and red pepper flakes. Stir in
cream and heat over medium high. Bring sauce to a boil,
stirring frequently, and adjust flavor with salt and pepper,
if needed. Allow sauce to bubble until desired consistency
is achieved, 3 to 4 minutes. Return cooked chicken tenders
to the skillet and warm in the sauce, about 1 minute.
Garnish with fresh parsley.

Crispy Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches


Ingredients
3 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
⅔ cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon Buffalo sauce
1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ cup canola oil, or as needed
6 hamburger buns
2 tablespoons Buffalo sauce, or to taste
½ cup sliced pickles
6 slices tomato
6 leaves lettuce, or more to taste
3 tablespoons ranch dressing, or more to taste

Cooking Instructions

Slice each chicken breast horizontally into 2 thin fillets.
Place 6 fillets in a resealable zip-top bag with buttermilk,
1 tablespoon Buffalo sauce, and garlic powder. Seal the bag
and shake to blend ingredients and evenly coat the chicken.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Preheat the
oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine flour,
poultry seasoning, and pepper in a shallow dish or pie
plate. Blend with a fork or whisk. Remove chicken from the
marinade and shake off excess. Dip chicken in the breading
mixture until well and evenly coated on both sides. Discard
the remaining marinade. Add enough oil to a large skillet so
that it thickly coats the bottom and heat over medium-high
heat until sizzling but not smoking. Place 2 chicken fillets
in the skillet so they fit comfortably; do not overcrowd.
Fry until crispy and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Drain chicken on paper towels and repeat twice, adding more
oil as necessary, to fry remaining chicken. Transfer chicken
to a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken
is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8
to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove chicken from oven. Place a chicken fillet on the
bottom half of a bun. Add Buffalo sauce to taste. Top with
pickle slices, tomato, and lettuce. Spread ranch dressing on
the inside of the top bun and place over the sandwich.
Repeat to make remaining sandwiches.

Sous Vide Beef Tenderloin Roast


Ingredients
4 ½ pounds whole beef tenderloin
1 tablespoon sea salt/kosher salt (such as Redmonds®)
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
6 cloves garlic
3 fresh thyme sprigs, or to taste
rosemary sprig
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, or more as needed
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
1 splash red wine
1 tablespoon gelatin powder
1 cup cold water
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Trim and tie tenderloin together with kitchen twine the
night before cooking. Combine salt and pepper in a bowl and
season tenderloin on all sides. Place on a baking rack set
over a cookie sheet and allow to rest, uncovered, in the
refrigerator overnight. The next morning place tenderloin,
garlic, thyme, and rosemary into a sous vide vacuum bag and
seal using a vacuum sealer. Refrigerate until you are ready
to sous vide. Attach sous vide cooker to a heat-proof
container of water and set temperature to 133 degrees F (56
degrees C). Sous vide until tenderloin has reached the
desired temperature, 2 1/2 to 3 hours, depending on
thickness. About 30 minutes pour water in a metal bowl and
sprinkle gelatin powder on top. Allow to sit for 30 minutes
until gelatin blooms. Set on top of a double boiler over
simmering water and stir until a clear liquid forms. Do not
allow to boil. Remove tenderloin from sous vide, pat dry,
and let rest while preparing the gravy. Pour au jus liquids
from the sous vide bag into a sauce pan. Stir in 1 to 2
tablespoons butter and red wine. Add as much of the bloomed
gelatin as you like depending on desired thickness and whisk
until well combined. Season gravy with salt, pepper, and
herbs to taste. Heat cast iron pan to medium-high. Brush
tenderloin with olive oil and sear in the hot pan until
browned all over, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Melt extra butter
in the pan as desired. Remove from pan, tent with foil, and
allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Slice tenderloin and
serve with gravy.

Sous Vide Tri Tip


Ingredients
1 (2 1/2 to 3 pound) tri tip steak, fat cap trimmed to 1/4-inch thick
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon kosher salt, divided
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 tablespoon coriander seeds, coarsely ground
1 tablespoon black peppercorns, coarsely ground
2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
½ cup fresh lime juice (from 3 large limes)
½ cup fish sauce
¼ cup dark brown sugar
4 medium garlic cloves, grated with a Microplane grater (about 2 tsp.)
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated with a Microplane grater (about 1 1/2 tsp.)
2 medium green onions, white bottoms finely chopped and green tops thinly sliced crosswise (about 2 Tbsp. minced white bottoms, about 1/4 cup thinly sliced green tops)
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
½ teaspoon toasted sesame oil

Cooking Instructions

Prepare a thermocirculator and water bath according to
manufacturer's directions. Set thermocirculator to 135
degrees F (57 degrees C) and allow water bath to come up to
temperature. Using gloved hands, rub tri tip steak evenly
with sesame oil and season evenly with 1 teaspoon salt.
Transfer tri tip and butter to a large vacuum-sealable bag
and arrange in a flat, even layer. Seal bag with a vacuum
sealer according to manufacturer's directions. Transfer
vacuum-sealed tri tip to warm water bath with
thermocirculator, cover vessel with aluminum foil to reduce
evaporation, and cook 3 hours. Remove tri tip from bag (meat
will be at 135 degrees F (57 degrees C) when pulled from
water bath) and transfer to a rimmed sheet pan lined with
paper towels and gently pat dry; discard bag and any juices
reserved in bag. Meanwhile prepare the chile-lime dipping
sauce. Whisk together lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar,
garlic, ginger, green onions, sesame seeds, and toasted
sesame oil in a small bowl until well combined. Cover
dipping sauce with plastic wrap and set aside at room
temperature until ready to use. Season tri tip evenly with
remaining 2 teaspoons salt, coriander seeds, and black
peppercorns, pressing coriander and black peppercorns into
tri tip to adhere. Heat grapeseed oil in a large cast iron
skillet over medium-high heat. Add tri tip to skillet, fat-
cap-side down, and cook, until all sides are evenly seared
and caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer tri tip
to a large cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes before
slicing against the grain into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Serve
steak with chile-lime dipping sauce for dipping, if desired.

Triple Seared Whiskey Burger


Ingredients
1 pound ground beef
2 teaspoons avocado oil
2 tablespoons sea salt
1/3 cup whiskey
1/4 cup soy sauce

Cooking Instructions

Wet your hands, and form 2 (8-ounce) burgers; place on a
plate, cover, and refrigerate until ready to grill. For this
process, cold meat works best. Before starting the triple-
searing process, build a very hot hardwood charcoal fire.
Oak, mesquite or hickory are great choices. The coals should
be glowing red, and radiating extreme heat before the meat
hits the grill. Rub burgers all over with oil. Coat with sea
salt until entire surface area is completely covered. Pour
whiskey into a shallow bowl; set aside. Place burgers on
hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides, 2 minutes
per side. Transfer burgers into bowl of whiskey, and turn
constantly for at least 1 minute. Most of the salt will
rinse off. Place burgers back onto the hottest spot on the
grill, and sear both sides again, 2 minutes per side. You
can baste steak with a small amount of whiskey while
searing. Add soy sauce to another shallow bowl. Add burgers
to the bowl, and turn constantly for at least 1 minute.
Return burgers to the hottest spot on the grill for the 3rd
and final sear. Grill each side until desired doneness is
reached, about 2 minutes. For a rosy-pink (medium-rare)
inside, remove when an instant-read thermometer inserted
near the center reads 125 to 130 F (52 to 54 degrees C).

World's Best Lasagna


Ingredients
1 pound sweet Italian sausage
¾ pound lean ground beef
½ cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
½ cup water
2 tablespoons white sugar
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves
1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
½ teaspoon fennel seeds
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
12 lasagna noodles
16 ounces ricotta cheese
1 egg
¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Gather all your ingredients. Cook sausage, ground beef,
onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until
well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato
paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley,
basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and
pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring
occasionally. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a
boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a
mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Preheat the oven
to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). To assemble, spread 1 ½
cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping
slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top
with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups
meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup
Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining
mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent
sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure
the foil does not touch the cheese. Bake in the preheated
oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before
serving.

Air Fryer Smashed Potatoes


Ingredients
8 ounces baby gold potatoes
1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Meanwhile, place potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl: cook on
high until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer potatoes
to a baking sheet and use the bottom of a small glass to
gently "smash" them to 3/4 or 1/2-inch thick. The thinner
you flatten the potatoes, the crispier they will be. Brush
melted butter over the tops of smashed potatoes. Season with
salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Place potatoes in the
basket of the air fryer in an even layer; cook until golden
and crisp, about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve
hot.

Big Fat Fondant Potatoes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon miso paste
1 1/2 teaspoons dashi powder
6 large russet potatoes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2/3 cup chicken broth

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring
chicken broth to a simmer; whisk in miso and dashi. Turn off
the heat; set aside until needed. Turn potatoes onto
narrowest side; trim straight down to create a flat surface.
Turn and trim the other side with a straight cut parallel to
the first. Cut a little off each end to square the potato a
bit more, then make 2 angled cuts on each side of the
squared ends. Transfer to a bowl of cold water. Reserve
trimmings for another use. Drain, and dry with paper towels.
Place a large cast-iron pan or other heavy ovenproof skillet
on high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil; place potatoes in
skillet with largest flat side down. Season tops with half
the salt. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook until well
browned, about 4 minutes. Turn potatoes over and repeat, to
salt and brown the other side, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat
to medium, and use a paper towel to soak up excess oil
between potatoes in the pan. Add butter, and as it melts,
baste tops of potatoes with melted butter. Once butter has
toasted to a light brown color, turn off the heat and strain
in the miso dashi broth. Roast potatoes, uncovered, in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Remove and turn
potatoes over. Add the 2/3 cup plain chicken broth, and
return to the oven to continue roasting at 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C) until potatoes can be pierced very easily
with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes more. Check occasionally to
see if broth has evaporated; add more as needed. Brush tops
of potatoes with pan drippings, and serve.

pickle. Fill jar with brine; you may have brine left over.
Add a fermenting weight or an inverted, sanitized plastic
lid to keep vegetables submerged. Cover jar with a kitchen
towel, securing with a rubber band. Let stand at room
temperature for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days. You’ll
start to see bubbles forming. The vegetables will become
more tart and the brine will become cloudier the longer the
pickles stand. Remove fermenting weight and screw on metal
lid. Chill up to 3 weeks.

Roasted Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce


Ingredients
1 pound asparagus,
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 large egg yolks
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon water
1/2 cup butter
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
1 large hard boiled egg, peeled
1 tablespoon chives (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Place asparagus on
the prepared pan and drizzle olive oil over the spears.
Season with salt and pepper. Using clean hands, toss
asparagus spears until evenly coated with olive oil and
seasonings, then spread asparagus in a single layer on the
pan. Roast in the center of the preheated oven until fork-
tender, 10 to 12 minutes; thicker asparagus may require more
time. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, and water
together in a heavy saucepan or small skillet with a wire
whisk until well blended. Season with salt and pepper. Turn
heat to medium-low; and whisk continuously, being careful to
stir the entire bottom and sides of the pan, until eggs
begin to thicken slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. If eggs start to
curdle, remove pan from heat, and continue whisking briskly
and continuously until any lumps disappear. Gradually whisk
in hot melted butter, about a tablespoon at a time, whisking
briskly after each addition. Adjust salt and pepper, if
necessary, and stir in cayenne pepper. When whisking, each
stroke of the whisk should reveal the bottom of the pan. If
the sauce is too thick, whisk in a drop or two of water or
lemon juice. To serve, plate asparagus and pour Hollandaise
sauce on top. Grate hard-boiled egg over Hollandaise, and
garnish with snipped chives.

1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
6 slices bacon
1 onion
4 green onions, divided
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
4 ounces okra, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cloves garlic
2 tomatoes
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, or to taste (optional)
2 cups peanut oil or other vegetable oil for frying
3 large eggs
1 1/2 pounds shrimp,
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 green onions, thinly sliced
chopped parsley for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine water, milk, butter, and salt in a large saucepan
and bring just to a boil. Whisk in grits until incorporated.
Reduce heat to simmer, cover, and cook until thick, 25 to 30
minutes, stirring often. If mixture gets too thick, add a
little more milk or water. Cut kernels off corn cobs, and
using the back of the knife, carefully scrape the cob to
release the creamy corn milk. Stir corn kernels and corn
milk into grits and continue cooking until grits are creamy
and tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer, stirring often. Stir in
pepper and adjust seasonings if necessary. Meanwhile, heat a
large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add olive
oil and bacon slices in a single layer, and cook until bacon
is crisp, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Remove
bacon from the skillet, drain on paper towels, and set
aside. Crumble bacon once cool enough to handle. Reserve
drippings in the skillet and return skillet to medium-high
heat. Finely slice green onions and reserve green ends for
garnish. Add white parts of green onion, onion, green and
red bell peppers, and okra to the skillet and cook until
softened and lightly browned, stirring often, about 5
minutes. Add in salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne and
cook for 1 minute. Add fresh tomatoes and garlic, and cook
for 2 minutes. Add butter to mixture and allow it to melt.
Sprinkle flour over skillet and cook, stirring constantly,
about 1 minute. Add in tomatoes, with juices, and stock
while stirring constantly until smooth. Stir in sugar,
Worcestershire, and hot sauce, and return mixture to a
simmer. Cook gravy for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Heat peanut oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large,
deep skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs in a bowl;
add shrimp and stir to coat. In a shallow dish, whisk flour,
salt, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Working a
few at a time, remove shrimp from egg, allowing excess to
drip off, and lightly coat in flour mixture. Transfer shrimp
to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with
remaining shrimp. Working in batches, add shrimp to hot oil
and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned and
crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on a wire rack set over a paper
towel-lined baking sheet. To serve, place grits in the
bottom of a shallow bowl. Top with about 1/2 cup of gravy
and 6 to 8 shrimp. Top with crumbled bacon, and sprinkle
with green onions and parsley if desired.

Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Pour the soup into a
blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold
down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and
carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get
the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in
batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately,
you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the
cooking pot. Cook and stir mushrooms and asparagus tips in
the same skillet used for bacon until mushrooms give up
their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and ground
black pepper, if needed. Stir mushrooms, asparagus tips, and
half-and-half cream to pureed soup. Cook until thoroughly
heated. Garnish soup with crumbled bacon.

stirring occasionally, until lightly browned but still soft,
about 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Set

Air Fryer Cinnamon Roll Bites


Ingredients
1 (12.4 ounce) cinnamon rolls
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon orange peel
1 tablespoon orange juice
icing

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Add sugar and
cinnamon to a large resealable plastic bag, and shake to
combine. Remove the 8 cinnamon rolls from the can, and set
icing aside. Cut each roll into 4 equal pieces for a total
of 32 bites. Line the fryer basket with parchment paper.
Place the bites in a single layer in the bottom of the
basket, cook for 3 minutes, turn over using tongs, and cook
until golden brown, another 2 to 3 minutes. Depending on the
brand and size of your air fryer, you may have to cook in
batches, and your timing may vary, so watch closely.
Meanwhile, prepare the dip. Add cream cheese, confectioner’s
sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and the packaged icing to
a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed
until you reach a dipping consistency, about 1 minute. Drop
the warm pieces into the sugar-cinnamon mixture, and shake.
Transfer to a plate or basket, and serve with the dip.

Banana Bread Brownies


Ingredients
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 ounces dark chocolate, broken into pieces
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 large egg
2 bananas, mashed (about 1 cup)
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
12 slices banana (optional)
2 tablespoons white sugar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Generously butter a 9x9-inch square pan. A piece of
parchment paper can also be added to the bottom of the pan
to prevent sticking. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Melt chocolate
in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second
intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an
electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg, vanilla, and
mashed banana, and beat until combined. Add chocolate, and
beat until mixture is well combined and smooth. Use a
spatula to mix in walnuts and chocolate chips, then use the
spatula to mix in flour just until flour disappears.
Transfer batter into the prepared pan and smooth top. Place
banana slices on top, evenly spaced in a grid pattern. Bake
in the preheated oven until a skewer comes out almost clean
but with some batter on the very tip. If you want fudgier
brownies, do not overcook. Let brownies cool in the pan.
Cover, refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour, and serve
chilled. For optional banana brûlée: While brownies are
cooling, cover each banana slice with a half teaspoon of
sugar. Use a propane kitchen torch to melt the sugar until
dark brown and bubbling. Be careful not to char the edges of
the crust around the banana too much. This banana brûlée
step can also be done before the brownies go into the oven.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place
potatoes in a baking dish, and pierce skins several times
with a knife. Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until very
tender when tested with a knife, about 1 hour. Remove from
the oven, cover with a towel, and cool potatoes to room
temperature, about 30 minutes. Turn oven off. Place flour in
a bowl, and make a small well in the center with a fork.
Pour milk, water, and salt into the well, and stir with a
fork to form a shaggy dough. Pour in the 1 tablespoon melted
butter, and continue to mix with a fork until dough begins
to come together. Lightly flour your hand and knead in the
bowl until the sides of the bowl are clean, and dough forms
into a ball. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work
surface and knead until dough is smooth and slightly
elastic, 2 to 4 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and set
aside to rest for 15 to 30 minutes. Measure out 8 ounces of
cooled, cooked potato; add to a bowl and mash with the back
of a fork, until slightly chunky or completely smooth, as
desired. Add green onions, green chilies, mozzarella,
Cheddar, and feta cheese and stir thoroughly to combine.
Season with salt and pepper. Mash filling into a compact
disc, about 5 inches in diameter, in the bottom of the bowl.
Turn filling out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap tightly,
give filling a final shaping, and place in the refrigerator
until ready to use. Roll dough out on a well-floured work
surface into a 10- to 11-inch circle. Place chilled filling
disc in center of dough circle. Working around the circle,
fold dough up toward the center to cover filling completely,
pleating dough as needed and using a moistened finger to
stick dough together where it overlaps. Flour the top, and
flip over so the seam side is down. Again, flour the top of
filled dough, and roll gently into an even circle, 3/4- to
1-inch thick. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick
skillet over medium heat. Gently place filled bread in the
skillet and cook, covered, until the bottom is a light
golden brown, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip over, and
cook, covered, until the other side is golden, about 5
minutes. Turn bread back over, and brush top and sides with
remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter. Cook for 1 to 2
minutes more. If flatbread begins to bulge, poke a small
hole with a knife to release steam. Transfer to a cutting
board and cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stir honey
and pepper flakes together in a small bowl. Sprinkle
flatbread with green onions, cut into wedges, and serve with
spicy honey.

1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon sea salt
8 tablespoons) butter
3/4 cup yogurt
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large
baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together flour,
baking powder, baking soda, and fine sea salt in a large
bowl. Coat whole stick of butter in flour mixture. Grate
butter on the large holes of a box grater into bowl. (If

Classic Glazed Doughnuts


Ingredients
⅓ cup milk
⅓ cup cake flour
1 cup milk
4 ¼ cups cake flour, plus more for dusting
1 package active dry yeast
5 ounces evaporated milk
½ cup butter, melted and cooled
2 large eggs
¼ cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups vegetable oil for frying
3 cups powdered sugar
½ cup melted butter
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
⅛ teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons hot water

Cooking Instructions

For tangzhong, whisk together 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup cake
flour in a small saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, over
medium heat until a very thick paste forms, about 3 minutes
(watch constantly—it thickens quickly). Cool briefly. Heat 1
cup milk in a second saucepan to 105 degrees F to 115
degrees F (40 degrees C to 46 degrees C). Transfer warm milk
to the bowl of a stand mixer; stir in yeast and let stand
for 5 minutes. Add evaporated milk, melted butter, eggs,
sugar, salt, vanilla, the cooled tangzhong, and 2 cups cake
flour to the stand mixer. Using the paddle attachment, beat
at low speed until mixture is smooth, about 3 minutes.
Gradually beat in remaining 2 1/4 cups cake flour to make a
soft dough. Continue beating at low speed until dough is
smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Dough will be soft. Turn dough out
onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth, 2
to 3 minutes, adding 2 to 4 tablespoons additional cake
flour. Be careful not to add too much flour. (If dough
begins to stick to surface, use a bench scraper to lift
dough from surface and add a dusting of flour. If your dough
is too soft to knead, chill covered for 2 hours or up to
overnight before kneading.) Shape dough into a ball.
Transfer to a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease
surface; cover. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in
size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough and turn out onto
floured surface. Roll dough into a 10x15-inch rectangle
about 1/2-inch thick. If dough springs back, let it rest an
additional 10 minutes. Lightly flour 2 large baking sheets.
Cut dough using 3-inch and 1-inch round cutters to create
doughnuts and doughnut holes. Arrange cutouts 1 inch apart
on the prepared baking sheets. Cover with a towel and let
cutouts rise in a warm place until very light and fluffy,
about 1 hour. [If you have scraps, gently knead together,
being careful not to overwork dough; let rest 10 minutes
before cutting.] Arrange wire racks in two 10x15-inch rimmed
baking pans (one for cooling, one for finished glazed
doughnuts). About 20 minutes before doughnuts are done
rising, pour oil to a depth of 2 1/2 to 3 inches into a
large skillet or a deep-fat fryer. Heat to 365 degrees F
(185 degrees C). Working in batches of 2 to 3 doughnuts,
fry, turning once halfway through, until golden, about 90
seconds. Transfer to prepared cooling rack to cool slightly.
Repeat with remaining doughnuts. For doughnut holes, working
in batches, fry, constantly moving with a slotted spoon,
until evenly golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to prepared
rack to cool slightly. Whisk together powdered sugar, melted
butter, vanilla extract and salt in a bowl to make the
vanilla glaze. Whisk in hot water, 1 tablespoon at a time,
until desired consistency. If glaze thickens, stir in
additional hot water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Dip warm
doughnuts and doughnut holes into vanilla glaze, turning to
coat both sides. Arrange doughnuts on the second prepared
rack to allow glaze to set, about 30 minutes.

Orange Cinnamon Rolls


Ingredients
¾ cup warm whole milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 large egg, room temperature
1 large egg yolk, room temperature
½ cup unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons honey
1 ½ teaspoons freshly grated orange zest
¼ cup freshly squeezed orange juice
3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided, or more as needed
1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
cooking spray
½ cup unsalted butter, softened
½ cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 ½ teaspoons freshly grated orange zest
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon freshly grated orange zest
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed orange juice
¼ teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Pour warmed milk into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with
a paddle attachment for the dough. Sprinkle yeast evenly
over the surface of the milk. Let stand until foamy, 5 to 10
minutes. Add egg and egg yolk, butter, honey, orange zest,
and orange juice to the yeast mixture. Beat on low until
combined, about 45 seconds. Add 2 cups flour; beat on low
until a wet dough forms, about 1 minute. Turn off mixer;
switch to the dough hook attachment. Add 1 ½ cups flour and
salt, beat on medium until dough is soft and elastic, 7 to
10 minutes. If necessary, add an additional ½ cup flour,
tablespoon by tablespoon, using as little as possible to
achieve a soft dough. The dough should be quite sticky.
Gather dough into a ball and transfer to a large greased
bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise at room
temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. To make the
filling: Combine butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and orange
zest in a bowl. Mix with a spatula until smooth and creamy,
about 1 minute. Set aside. Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish;
set aside. Punch down the dough and transfer to a well-
floured surface. Roll dough into a large 10x18-inch
rectangle. Spread the filling over the surface of the dough,
leaving a ½ inch border along the top long edge. Roll the
dough away from you to create a log, and pinch seam to seal.
Cut dough log into 12 equal rolls (about 1 ½ inches wide).
Transfer rolls to prepared baking dish. Loosely cover with
plastic wrap, and set aside to rise at room temperature
until puffy and almost doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake
rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 22 to 25
minutes. While rolls are baking, prepare the frosting.
Combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, orange zest, orange
zest, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the
paddle attachment. Beat at medium-high speed until very
smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove rolls from oven
and transfer to a wire rack. Let cool 2 minutes, then spread
frosting evenly over the rolls. Serve warm.

Panettone


Ingredients
⅓ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
4 cups all-purpose flour
½ cup warm milk
⅔ cup white sugar
4 large eggs
2 large egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
12 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cups candied mixed fruit
2 ½ teaspoons grated lemon zest
2 tablespoons orange zest
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon cream
3 (7 x 4-inch) round paper panettone molds

Cooking Instructions

To make sponge, warm a small bowl by rinsing it with hot
water. Pour in warm water and sprinkle 1 package yeast on
it. Let stand until yeast has dissolved. Stir in 1/2 cup
flour, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand 30 minutes, or
until doubled. Sprinkle remaining yeast over warm milk. Let
stand until dissolved. Beat together sugar, eggs, egg yolks,
and vanilla. Stir in milk-yeast mixture. Add sponge and stir
until well incorporated. Combine butter and remaining 3 ½
cups flour until crumbly. Slowly pour in egg mixture and
beat on high speed 3 to 4 minutes, until dough is elastic
looking and long strands form. Beat in fruit and zests. Turn
dough into oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and leave in
a warm place to rise until doubled, about 2 to 3 hours.
Brush inside of three 7 x 4-inch paper molds with melted
butter. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface
and knead a few times to deflate. Divide dough into 3
pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and drop into prepared
molds; place on a baking sheet about 4-inches apart and
cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place
until doubled again, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400
degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut an X in top of each loaf with
oiled scissors. Combine egg yolk with cream. Brush tops of
loaves lightly with egg wash. Place baking sheet with loaves
in bottom 1/3 of preheated oven. After 10 minutes, lower
heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Continue to bake for
30 more minutes; if tops get too brown, cover with foil.
Loaves are done when a wooden skewer inserted into centers
comes out clean. Cool on wire rack.

6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/3 cup peanut butter
1 cup white sugar
2 large bananas
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons peanut butter
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 cup confectioner's sugar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a
12-cup muffin tin with paper liners, or grease cups. Whisk
together flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda; set
aside. Beat butter, peanut butter, and sugar together in a
bowl with an electric mixer or whisk until light and fluffy.
Add bananas and beat again until light and fluffy. Mix in
eggs one at a time; stir in milk and vanilla. Add flour
mixture; mix on low speed until about 75% of flour is
incorporated. Use a spatula to stir in chocolate chips, and
to fully incorporate flour. Divide batter evenly between
prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a
toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 23 to 25
minutes. Cool muffins in the tin for about 15 minutes;
transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes
more. For icing, combine peanut butter, milk, and powdered
sugar in a bowl and stir until a thick icing is formed. Add
more powdered sugar as needed for an icing thick enough to
hold its shape when piped. Add icing to a piping bag and
pipe in a zigzag pattern over cooled muffins.

Pretzel Crust Pizza


Ingredients
1 ¼ cups warm water
1 ½ tablespoons
1 (1/4-ounce) envelope active dry yeast
3 ½ cups
1 teaspoon
neutral cooking oil,
cooking spray
tablespoon
2 tablespoons hot water
2 cups part-skim mozzarella cheese
30 pepperoni slices
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
pretzel salt
1/3 cup whole milk
8 ounces processed cheese
1 tablespoon
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Prepare the pizza: Place warm water,
sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a
dough hook. Whisk until just combined, and let stand until
foamy, about 5 minutes. Add flour and salt; mix on low speed
until just combined, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to
medium, and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5
minutes. Shape dough into a ball, and transfer to a large
greased bowl, rotating dough to coat all sides in oil. Cover
with plastic wrap or a clean damp towel; let rest in a warm
area until doubled in size, 25 to 30 minutes. Preheat the
oven to 425 degrees F (230 degrees C) with a pizza stone or
overturned large rimmed baking sheet on the center rack.
Grease a large 15-inch pizza pan with cooking spray. Punch
down dough, and transfer to the prepared pizza pan. Using
clean hands, press dough to the outer edge of the pan (dough
should be 15 inches in diameter). Fold 1 to 1 1/2-inches of
dough’s outer edge over itself to create adefined crust
(dough should be 13 inches in diameter to the outer edge).
Combine baking soda and hot water in a small bowl. Using a
pastry brush, brush the top and outer edges of crust;
discard any remaining baking soda mixture. Bake crust on
pizza stone in preheated oven until crust is golden brown,
about 8 minutes. Meanwhile prepare the cheese sauce: Bring
milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium. Reduce
heat to low; add processed cheese, in batches, whisking
constantly until melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk in butter,
onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, and salt until smooth.
Set aside until ready to use. Spread cheese sauce evenly
over par-baked crust. Sprinkle with an even layer of
mozzarella cheese, and top evenly with pepperoni slices.
Brush outer crust with melted butter, and sprinkle evenly
with pretzel salt. Bake in the preheated oven at 425 degrees
F (230 degrees C) until mozzarella is slightly browned and
melted and crust is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove
from oven, and let cool on pizza pan for 5 minutes. Slice
and serve.

Sausage Gravy Kolaches


Ingredients
1/2 cup milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
1 package dry yeast
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 large egg
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour, plus more as needed
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
8 ounces ground pork breakfast sausage (or sausage links with casings removed)
1 1/2 teaspoons all purpose flour
4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
4 green onions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish
2 tablespoons milk
2 sage leaves, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne
1 large egg, beaten, divided

Cooking Instructions

Combine warm milk, yeast, sugar, salt, and melted butter in
the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attached. Add
egg and flour. Drop down dough hook and start kneading on
low speed, stopping and scraping down the sides every so
often in the beginning to make sure all the ingredients are
incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Once everything has come
together, increase speed 1 notch and continue kneading until
dough is very soft, very smooth, and slightly elastic, about
2 minutes. Transfer dough onto a work surface, knead for 1
minute, and shape into a smooth ball. Since the dough has
butter in it, it won’t be sticky. Return dough ball to a
lightly buttered bowl. Cover, and allow to rise in a warm
spot until it has doubled in size, about 90 minutes. Once
dough is risen, transfer to a work surface and punch down to
de-gas. Shape back into a ball, and weigh on a digital
scale. Divide amount by 8 and weigh out 8 equal dough
portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball, using just
enough flour to keep it from sticking. Press and flatten the
dough into a disc about 3 1/2-inches wide and a 1/2-inch
thick. Shape with your hands to make a small indention in
the middle. Transfer to a silpat-lined baking sheet. Cover
and let proof until almost doubles in size, 45 to 60
minutes. Combine cooled sausage, cream cheese, green onions,
milk, sage, ½ of the beaten egg, salt, pepper, and cayenne
in a bowl. Mix filling into a thick paste with a spoon.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) Use
slightly damp fingertips to press a well into the center of
each kolache to place the filling. Be sure to leave no more
that 3/4-inch of un-pressed dough around the outside. Do not
press all the way through the dough to the baking sheet.
Brush each kolache with remaining egg wash. Fill evenly with
the sausage cream cheese mixture. Bake in the preheated oven
until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven,
transfer to a wire rack, and allow to rest for 10 to 15
minutes before serving. Top with sliced green onions for
garnish.

Sour Cream Donuts


Ingredients
2 ¼ cups bleached cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
¾ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
⅔ cup sour cream, room temperature
½ cup granulated sugar
2 large egg yolks, room temperature
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
vegetable oil as needed for frying
4 ½ cups powdered sugar
½ cup unsalted butter, melted
6 tablespoons hot water
1 ½ teaspoons light corn syrup
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon
together in a bowl until well combined. Whisk sour cream,
granulated sugar, egg yolks, melted butter, oil, and vanilla
together in a large bowl until well combined. Gradually fold
flour mixture into sour cream mixture just until combined.
(Dough will be quite soft and sticky.) Cover, and chill in
the refrigerator until dough is cold and just slightly
firmed, about 2 hours. Turn dough out onto a heavily-floured
surface and pat or roll to 3/8- to 1/2-inch thickness,
flouring hands or rolling pin as needed. Cut dough using a
floured 3 ½-inch round cutter. Cut holes in the center of
the dough circles using a floured 1 ¼-inch round cutter.
Transfer dough rings to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Reroll, and cut dough scraps, repeating process as needed.
Heat 3 inches of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat
until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F to 365
degrees F (182 degrees C to 185 degrees C). Fry 1 to 2
donuts at a time until golden brown and cooked through,
about 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side, adjusting heat as necessary
to maintain oil temperature. Transfer donuts to a baking
sheet lined with paper towels using a spider strainer. Let
drain, and cool for 5 minutes (see note). Whisk together
powdered sugar, melted butter, hot water, corn syrup, salt,
and vanilla in a large bowl for the glaze until smooth and
well combined. Place 1 warm donut in the powdered sugar
mixture, craggy side up; use a spoon to coat donut
completely in the glaze. Remove donut from glaze using two
forks placed underneath; let excess drip off, and then
transfer donut to a wire rack placed over a rimmed baking
sheet. Repeat with remaining donuts and glaze. Let donuts
stand until glaze is set before serving, about 25 minutes.

Strawberry Lemon Cheesecake Rolls


Ingredients
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 (1/4-ounce) active dry yeast
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 large eggs
1/3 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest, divided
1 3/4 cups strawberry preserves
3/4 cup cheesecake filling
1/3 cup lemon curd
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. In a small saucepan, heat 1 cup of
the milk to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C) over low heat,
about 5 minutes. Pour warm milk into a liquid measuring cup,
and stir in sugar and yeast; let sit until foamy, about 5
minutes. Beat flour, eggs, butter, salt, and 1 teaspoon of
the lemon zest with a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook
attachment on medium speed until crumbly, about 1 minute.
With mixer on low speed, slowly stream in milk mixture until
fully combined, then increase speed to medium-low, and beat
until a smooth dough forms, 8 to 12 minutes. If needed, add
more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough is too sticky.
Transfer dough to a greased 13- x 9-inch baking pan, cover,
and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1
hour. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface;
roll into a 18- x 15-inch rectangle (about 1/4 inch thick).
Spread 1 1/2 cups of the preserves evenly over bottom two-
thirds of the dough starting on 1 long side, leaving a
1/2-inch border. Carefully roll dough into a log starting at
long side with with preserves. Some of the preserves may
spill out as you roll, that’s okay. Slice dough log into 12
rolls, and arrange, cut sides down, back into greased baking
pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place, until doubled in
size, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden
brown, about 25 minutes. Brush remaining 1/4 cup preserves
evenly over rolls. Let cool slightly at room temperature,
about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together cheesecake
filling, lemon curd, lemon juice, remaining 3 tablespoons
milk, and remaining 1 teaspoon lemon zest in a medium bowl
until combined. Drizzle desired amount of lemon curd mixture
over warm rolls. Serve any remaining lemon curd mixture on
the side.

Triple Coffee Sweet Rolls


Ingredients
1/4 cup espresso powder
2 cups milk,
2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon espresso powder
1 tablespoon cocoa
1 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar
3 tablespoons espresso or strong coffee, or more as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine 1/4 cup instant espresso and hot milk in the bowl of
a stand mixer, and let cool until just warm to the touch,
about 95 degrees F (35 degrees C). Add yeast, egg, white
sugar, salt, and 6 tablespoons melted butter. Add most of
the flour, attach the dough hook, and knead on low speed
until everything comes together and begins to pull away from
the sides of the bowl. Turn mixer speed up a notch, and
continue to knead until a smooth, soft, elastic dough forms,
adding in remaining flour as needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove
dough from the mixer, form into a ball, and place back in
the bowl. Cover and let it rise in a warm place until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, make filling. Melt
1/2 cup butter in a small pan over medium heat. Stir in
brown sugar, cocoa, and 1 tablespoon instant espresso
powder. Once combined, remove from heat and let cool. As
soon as butter starts to cool and solidify, stir to form a
thick, spreadable paste. Reserve until needed. Once dough
has risen, use your hands to press out the air, and reshape
into a ball. For best results, transfer dough to a plastic
bag and place in the refrigerator overnight. Dough can be
used right away if need be. Very lightly flour a work
surface. Turn dough out onto the work surface, press into a
rectangle, and very lightly dust the top with flour. Roll
out into a 12x18-inch rectangle. Spread filling evenly to
the edges, leaving a few inches along one of the long sides
free of filling. Lightly brush exposed dough with water;
this will help to seal the seam. Beginning with the long
side that has filling, roll dough and filling toward the
long side with exposed dough to form a uniform log,
finishing with the seam on the bottom. Generously butter a
9x12- or 13-inch baking dish or pan, and, if desired, line
the bottom with buttered parchment. Score the log of dough
into 12 equal portions, and then cut each portion with a
piece of string as shown. Place cut rolls into the prepared
pan. Cover rolls and leave to rise in a warm spot until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375
degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until
puffed, golden brown at the edges, and an instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center, reads 200 degrees F
(95 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes
before icing. Whisk together confectioner’s sugar with 3 to
4 tablespoons of espresso or strong coffee, or enough to
form an icing that can be drizzled over with a spoon.
Drizzle icing over rolls and let cool before serving, or
enjoy slightly warm.

Roasted Butternut Squash Salad


Ingredients
1 medium butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
6 slices bacon
1 cup sliced onion
8 cups chopped romaine lettuce
⅓ cup pecans, toasted and chopped
⅓ cup raisins
2 tablespoons maple syrup, or to taste

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Brush cut
sides of butternut squash with olive oil. Wrap each squash
half tightly in aluminum foil. Roast squash halves in the

Remove squash from the oven and let sit until cool enough to
handle. Remove foil and slice into 3/4-inch thick slices.
Remove skin from each slice and cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Set
aside 8 cups of the cubed squash, reserving any remaining
squash for another use. Place bacon in a large skillet and
cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until
crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove bacon and drain on paper
towels. Add onions to the skillet and cook in the bacon
grease for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 8 cups squash and cook,
tossing occasionally, until onions are soft and beginning to
caramelize, and squash cubes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Place romaine lettuce in a large serving bowl; crumble bacon
on top and add pecans and raisins. Add butternut squash-
onion mixture; toss to combine. Drizzle with maple syrup and
serve warm.

Air Fryer Spinach


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Make filling: Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium
heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3
minutes. Add bell pepper and mushrooms; cook, stirring
occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Remove from
heat and stir in spinach and garlic; continue stirring until
spinach is slightly wilted. Season with Italian seasoning,
salt, and pepper. Let cool for 10 minutes. Stir in feta
cheese, breaking up any large pieces. Prepare chicken: Pat
chicken dry and place on a cutting board. Cut a pocket in
each breast by inserting a knife into the thickest part of
the breast and slicing parallel to the cutting board,
leaving about 1 inch at each tip. Be careful not to cut all
the way through the thinnest edge of the breast. Preheat an
air fryer to 370 degrees F (190 degrees C) if preheating is
recommended by the manufacturer. Separate prosciutto slices
and place onto a clean surface. Place 2 tablespoons filling
onto each slice; roll prosciutto around filling to create an
oblong bundle. Tuck one bundle into each sliced chicken
breast and close the opening with a few toothpicks. Place
beaten egg into a shallow bowl. Combine Parmesan cheese,
bread crumbs, parsley, salt, and pepper in another shallow
bowl. Dip each stuffed chicken breast into beaten egg, then
dredge in bread crumb mixture. Spray both sides with cooking
spray and place into the air fryer basket. Cook chicken in
the preheated air fryer until browned, about 15 minutes per
side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
of meat should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Chef Johns Tortilla de Patatas


Ingredients
2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or russet potatoes, peeled
1 yellow onion
5 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 cup olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Slice potatoes and onions with a very sharp knife or
mandoline into 1/8-inch thick slices. Combine eggs, 1/2
teaspoon salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl and
whisk very thoroughly; set aside. Add 1/3 cup olive oil to a
large nonstick pan and set heat to medium-high. Add
potatoes, onions, and remaining salt. Cook, tossing and
stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, and some
onions and potatoes are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
Between stirrings, cover potatoes to reduce cooking time and
keep in moisture. For less browning, reduce heat to medium.
Stir potato mixture into egg mixture with a spatula. Cover
and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Add remaining olive oil
to an 8- or 9-inch nonstick pan, and set the pan over
medium-high heat. Pour in egg and potato mixture, and smooth
the top. Cook, covered, for about 4 minutes or until the
bottom is browned and the edges of tortilla begin to firm
up. Slide tortilla out onto a plate, cover with another
plate, and flip the plates over to invert. Slide tortilla
back into the pan, and place back over medium-high heat.
Cook, uncovered, until the tortilla is fully set, about 2
minutes more. Tortilla will spring back lightly when pressed
in the middle with a finger if eggs are fully cooked. If it
feels soft or mushy when pressed, cook for a few minutes
more, unless you prefer the tortilla less than fully set.
Slip tortilla onto a serving plate, and serve hot, warm, or
room temperature.

Crpes Suzette


Ingredients
½ cup whole milk
⅓ cup water
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon white sugar
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¾ cup all-purpose flour
¼ cup unsalted butter, melted, divided
1 teaspoon freshly grated orange zest
⅓ cup fresh orange juice
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
¼ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 tablespoon orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier)
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ cup orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier)
½ cup vanilla ice cream, or to taste

Cooking Instructions

To make the crêpes: Combine milk, water, eggs, sugar, and
salt in a blender; blend on medium speed until smooth, about
10 seconds. Add flour and blend until smooth, about 5 more
seconds. Add 2 tablespoons of the melted butter and orange
zest; pulse until incorporated, about 3 (1-second) pulses.
Cover blender and place in refrigerator; let rest for 15
minutes. Remove crêpe batter from fridge. Heat a 6-inch
nonstick skillet or crêpe pan over medium heat. Add 1/2
teaspoon of the melted butter and swirl to coat skillet. Add
2 tablespoons batter and swirl to coat bottom of skillet.
Cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is lightly golden, and
the top is still a little moist, about 1 minute. Swirl
skillet to loosen crêpe and gently flip with a spatula and
your fingers. Cook until golden, about 30 seconds. Transfer
to a plate. Repeat with remaining butter and batter. To make
the orange sauce: Combine orange juice, white sugar, and
orange zest in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook,
stirring often, until sugar is dissolved and the liquid
starts to bubble, 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually add butter,
piece by piece, stirring constantly, until it is melted and
fully incorporated. Let sauce come back up to a simmer and
let simmer until slightly syrupy, stirring occasionally,
about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in orange liqueur and salt.
Remove from the heat. Fold each crêpe in half, then half
again to make a triangle. Dip the folded crêpes into the hot
orange sauce. Place on a serving platter. Repeat with
remaining crêpes, overlapping each crêpe so they are facing
the same direction. To serve, pour orange liqueur into the
skillet with the remaining orange sauce and place over
medium-high. If it does not ignite automatically, use a
long-stemmed lighter and carefully set the liqueur on fire.
Let it burn for about 30 seconds. Pour the flaming liqueur
over the crêpes on the platter and serve immediately with
ice cream.

Halloumi and Zucchini Frittata


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large zucchini, grated and squeezed dry
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
4 large eggs
4 ounces halloumi cheese, sliced

Strawberry Rhubarb Drop Biscuits


Ingredients
1 1/4 cups rhubarb
1 1/4 cups strawberries
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stick unsalted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons fruit syrup
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 large egg (optional)
2 teaspoons water (optional)
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into
1/4-inch pieces; place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries
and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss to combine, cover, and let
fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Combine
flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing
bowl; whisk to combine. Drain fruit in a strainer set over a
bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices that pass through. Grate
frozen butter into the flour mixture, while stirring with a
fork several times to coat butter pieces with flour. Add 1/4
cup sugar, and drained fruit, mixing with a fork until fruit
is coated with flour. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved
fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk. Mix with a fork just
until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough.
If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little
more buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a
little more flour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230
degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat. Scoop or
spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking
sheet. Whisk together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush
biscuits with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack
and let cool completely. Mix powdered sugar, lemon zest, and
lemon juice together in a small bowl for the lemon icing.
Fill icing into a piping bag or a plastic bag with the tip
cut off and drizzle icing over cooled biscuits.

While grits are cooking, make the shrimp sauce: Place bacon
in a large, deep skillet over medium heat; cook until bacon
fat is rendered, about 3 minutes. Stir in shallot and
garlic; cooking and stirring until shallots are tender,
about 5 minutes. Pour in white wine and stir in butter,
cooking and stirring until butter has melted. Drop shrimp in
the skillet; cook and stir until they are bright pink on the
outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center,
about 3 minutes. Stir in spinach, mushrooms, and green
onions; cook and stir until the spinach wilts, about 2
minutes more. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon. Stir in
heavy cream to the sauce. Simmer until the cream is reduced
by about a third, about 10 minutes. Season with hot sauce,
salt, and pepper. Return shrimp to the skillet to heat
through. Serve shrimp with sauce over the prepared grits.

omelets


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Add eggs to a bowl, along with water, soy sauce, mirin,
salt, sugar, and cayenne. Use a fork to beat eggs until
whites are completely incorporated. Transfer egg mixture
into a pourable measuring cup. Set a 10-inch non-stick pan
over medium heat. Mix sesame and vegetable oil in a small
bowl, and use a brush to oil the pan. Pour in 1/3 of egg
mixture. Tilt the pan to cover the bottom with eggs. Cook
until omelet is about halfway set, then use a spatula to
turn over about 1 inch of edge toward the center on 3 sides
to square the shape on those 3 sides. If eggs seem to be
cooking too fast, reduce heat to medium-low. Use a spatula
to roll the omelet toward the rounder side, to form a
rectangular roll, about 2 inches wide by 8 inches long.
Slide omelet over to about 3 inches from the edge of the
pan, and brush more oil over the pan surface. Pour the
second 1/3 of eggs around the omelet. Lift omelet slightly
with the spatula so that some eggs flow underneath. Raise
heat back to medium, if it was reduced. When egg layer is
halfway set, use a spatula to roll this layer up and over
the already-folded omelet in the pan, and continue to roll
into a rectangle. Add remaining 1/3 of egg mixture, and
repeat cooking and rolling steps to make the final layer.
Transfer omelet onto plastic wrap, and use it to shape the
omelet, before wrapping and rolling it into a tight package;
cover with a towel and let rest for 5 minutes. Unwrap, slice
into 6 or 8 pieces, and serve on a warm plate. Sprinkle with
furikake.

5 1/2 cups whole milk
2 tablespoons rose water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon saffron threads, crushed to a powder
1 1/2 cups whipping cream
1/3 cup pistachios

Hamburger Bun Bread Pudding


Ingredients
3 tablespoons butter
8 brioche-style hamburger buns
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
5 large eggs
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons whiskey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups milk
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon ketchup
1 teaspoon mustard
1 teaspoon mayonnaise
1/3 cup golden raisins (optional)
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup whiskey
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 pinch salt

Cooking Instructions

Butter a 9x12-inch or 9x13-inch baking dish with 3
tablespoons butter and set aside. If buns are not already
stale and relatively dry, split them open and spread out on
a baking sheet. Bake at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) until
very lightly toasted, about 20 minutes. Let cool. For
custard batter, combine eggs, white sugar, whiskey, vanilla,
cinnamon, salt, milk, cream, ketchup, mustard, and
mayonnaise in a bowl; whisk to combine. Lay 6 bun bottoms
into the prepared baking dish. Break last 2 bun bottoms and
1/2 of a top bun into large pieces and use pieces to fill in
the gaps. Ladle half of custard mixture over buns. Place 6
bun tops over bottom layer and use the last 1 1/2 top buns
to fill in the center gap. Ladle remaining custard mixture
over. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or
preferably up to 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Brush the tops of buns with some of the
custard mixture and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake in the
preheated oven until buns are browned and puffed up, about 1
hour. Remove to cool on a wire rack. For whiskey sauce, add
butter, whiskey, brown sugar, water, and a pinch of salt to
a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Turn off heat and let cool before using. Sauce will thicken
as it cools.

Lemon Coconut Cake


Ingredients
6 large egg yolks,
2/3 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons lemon zest
3/4 cup lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes
3 cups cake flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup sour cream,
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup coconut milk
6 large egg whites,
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
4 cups confectioner's sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon coconut milk
1 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes

Cooking Instructions

For lemon curd, add egg yolks, sugar, lemon zest, lemon
juice, salt, and butter to a small non-reactive saucepan
over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until
mixture begins to simmer and has thickened, 8 to 12 minutes.
Pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl,
using a spatula or wooden spoon to push the mixture through.
Cover with a piece of plastic wrap directly touching the top
of the curd, and refrigerate until chilled. For cakes,
preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease 3 8-inch round cake pans, and line the bottoms with
parchment paper. Place coconut flakes into a food processor
or blender, and pulse a few times until coconut flakes are
finely chopped. Set aside. Sift cake flour, baking powder,
salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. In a separate
large bowl, beat butter, vegetable oil, and sugar together
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 4
minutes. Add in sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and mix
until thoroughly combined. Add in 1/2 of flour mixture and
mix until just combined. Add in coconut milk and mix until
just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until
just combined. In a separate clean bowl, combine egg whites
and cream of tartar. With clean beaters, beat egg whites on
medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.
Add 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the batter, and fold
just until no streaks of whites remain. Add in remaining egg
white mixture and gently fold until no streaks of white
remain. Divide batter evenly between the 3 prepared cake
pans. Bake in the preheated oven until tops of cakes spring
back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cakes to
cool in pans for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack
to cool completely. For frosting, cut cold butter into
1/2-inch pieces. Place into a bowl. Starting on low speed,
beat butter with an electric mixer until just loosened.
Gradually increase the mixer speed, and beat butter until
smooth, about 2 minutes. Add in cold cream cheese, and beat
on medium-high speed until completely smooth and combined,
about 3 minutes. Add in confectioner’s sugar; beat until
thoroughly combined. Add in lemon zest, vanilla, and salt
and mix until combined. Add in remaining confectioner’s
sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add in 1 tablespoon cold coconut milk and beat mixture on
medium-high speed for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. If
frosting is a bit too soft to spread onto the cake layers,
place it into the fridge for about 10 minutes, or until it
is easier to use. To assemble the cake, place one cake layer
onto a cake plate or serving platter. Spread a thin layer of
cream cheese frosting over the top of the cake. Pipe a ring
of frosting around the top edge of the cake. Place about 2
tablespoons of lemon curd in the center of the frosting
ring, and smooth into an even layer. Stack another cake
layer on top of the first, and repeat the process of
frosting and filling. When the last cake layer is stacked on
top, frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer
of frosting. Use your hands to press the toasted coconut
flakes onto the sides of the cake. If desired, drizzle or
swirl the top of cake with some of the extra lemon curd.
Place cake into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes
before serving.

1 3/4 cups white sugar
6 large egg yolks
3/4 cup limoncello liquor
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar
3 tablespoons limoncello liquor
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1/8 teaspoon salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Sift cake
flour, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a
bowl. Combine egg whites and cream of tartar in a large
bowl. Beat on medium speed with an electric mixer until

pour in 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a
time, and continue beating until mixture forms stiff, glossy
peaks, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside. In another bowl, add egg
yolks and remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar. Beat until mixture has
increased in volume and lightened in color, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add in 3/4 cup limoncello, olive oil, 1/4 cup heavy cream, 2
tablespoons lemon juice, 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon zest, and
vanilla and mix until thoroughly combined. Pour in 1/2 of
the sifted cake flour mixture and mix until just combined.
Add in remaining flour mixture plus 1 tablespoon poppy seeds
and mix on low speed until just combined. Add in 1/3 of the
whipped egg whites, and gently fold in until no streaks of
white remain. Add in remaining egg whites and fold gently
until no streaks of white remain. Place an ungreased 10-inch
tube pan with removable bottom onto a baking sheet. Pour
batter evenly into the tube pan. Bake in the preheated oven
until top of the cake begins to turn golden and feels mostly
set, 55 to 65 minutes. Remove pan from oven and invert onto
a wire rack to cool completely, about 90 minutes. Once cake
is cooled, gently run a knife around the edges of the pan to
loosen. Remove cake, then run knife along the top and center
to remove from the pan insert. Place cake onto a serving
platter. To make glaze, whisk together powdered sugar, 3
tablespoons limoncello, 2 tablespoons heavy cream, 1
teaspoon lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest, and 1/8
teaspoon salt until smooth. Pour glaze over cooled cake.

Perfect Cheesecake with Strawberry Topping


Ingredients
14 graham crackers
1/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, melted
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs
2 quarts fresh strawberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup water

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Break
graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor. Add sugar
and pulse until large crumbs form. Add butter and pulse just
until combined and mixture resembles slightly wet sand.
Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan; press mixture
lightly into the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of the
pan. Bake in the preheated oven until fragrant and slightly
golden brown around the edges, about 8 minutes. Let cool.
Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil. Place cream cheese
in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using a paddle attachment,
whip cheese on medium speed just until smooth, to avoid
incorporating too much air. Add sugar and beat until smooth,
scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add in sour
cream, vanilla, lemon juice and salt and blend until just
combined. With the mixer on low speed, add eggs, one at a
time, mixing until each egg is fully incorporated, then mix
until just combined and smooth, scraping down the sides of
the bowl as needed. Pour mixture into the prepared crust.
Wrap bottom and sides of pan well with heavy duty aluminum
foil. Place the pan inside a large deep roasting pan and set
pan in the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the
roasting pan around the cheesecake without letting any water
inside the foil wrap or the cheesecake. Bake in the
preheated oven until the center is very slightly jiggly,
about 50 minutes. Carefully remove pans from the oven and
allow cheesecake to cool in the water bath for 15 to 20
minutes. After about 10 minutes, just when cheesecake starts
to release itself from the sides, run a knife around the
sides. Remove wrapped cheesecake from water bath and place
on a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Unwrap
cheesecake and place in refrigerator until fully chilled and
ready to serve, at least 4 hours. Place 1/2 of strawberries
in a large saucepan and stir in sugar, lemon, vanilla,
cornstarch, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat,
stirring often. Reduce heat to medium high and allow mixture
to simmer until berries are softened. Using a potato masher,
mash strawberries until slightly chunky; continue to simmer
until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in
remaining strawberries, and let cool to room temperature.
Refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve cheesecake slices
with strawberry topping.

S'mores Cupcakes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
6 tablespoons brown sugar
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch cinnamon
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon espresso powder
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup brown sugar
1 large egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup sour cream
18 large marshmallows
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
2/3 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon almond extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2
cupcake pans with liners. Prepare the crust: Mix graham
cracker crumbs, melted butter, brown sugar, salt, nutmeg,
and cinnamon together in a small bowl until combined. Place
1 packed tablespoon of crumb mixture into the bottom of
about 18 cupcake liners and press into an even layer. Bake
in the preheated oven until graham cracker crusts are
slightly darker in color, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow crusts to
cool. Prepare cupcakes: Whisk boiling water, cocoa powder,
and espresso powder together In a small bowl or measuring
cup until smooth and combined. Set aside to cool slightly.
Beat butter, vegetable oil, and brown sugar in a large bowl
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3
minutes. Add in egg, vanilla, and salt. Beat for an
additional 3 minutes on medium-high speed. Add in cocoa
powder mixture and beat until thoroughly incorporated. Add
in cake flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and mix until
just combined. Add in sour cream; mix until just combined.
Spoon about 2 heaped tablespoons of cake batter over each
graham cracker crust, making sure to fill each liner no more
than 2/3 full. (There may be extra batter to make 1 or 2
extra cupcakes without a graham cracker crust. Simply put
that batter into an empty liner, filling no more than 2/3
full, and bake as a plain chocolate cupcake). Bake in the
preheated oven, 1 pan at a time, until tops of the cupcakes
spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow
cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before carefully
removing to a wire rack to cool completely. To prepare
frosting, place an oven rack directly below the oven's
broiler; preheat broiler. Line a baking sheet with parchment
paper and lightly grease it. Place large marshmallows about
1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Place pan under broiler
and cook until marshmallows are golden brown and puffy,
rotating the pan often to ensure the tops of the
marshmallows brown evenly without burning, about 1 minute.
Remove pan from oven and allow marshmallows to cool. Place
egg whites, white sugar, cold water, cream of tartar, and
pinch of salt in a very large heatproof mixing bowl. Place
the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water (do not allow
the bottom of the bowl to touch the water), and begin to
beat the mixture on low speed with an electric hand mixer.
Gradually increase speed to medium-high and continue to whip
mixture over hot water until mixture holds stiff peaks, 8 to
10 minutes. Remove from heat and beat for 1 minute more. Add
in toasted marshmallows, vanilla, and almond extract.
Beginning on low speed and gradually increasing the speed to
high, beat mixture until completely smooth and no lumps of
toasted marshmallow remain, and the mixture once again holds
stiff peaks, 5 to 7 minutes. Place mixture into a large
piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Generously pipe
marshmallow frosting onto the top of each cooled cupcake. If
desired, use a kitchen torch to caramelize the frosting
until golden brown.

3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar
3 large egg whites

filling each liner no more than 2/3 full. Bake one pan at a
time, until tops of cupcakes spring back when lightly
touched, 22 to 26 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan
for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool
completely, about 30 minutes Chill cupcakes in the
refrigerator for about 1 hour. This will make them easier to
cut and fill. Cream cheese whipped cream: Beat chilled cream

to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. Place tops of cupcakes
back on, and lightly press down to adhere. Pipe more whipped
cream on top of cupcakes and top with another 1 to 2
teaspoons strawberry mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for
30 minutes before serving.

These Copycat Choco Tacos Taste Just Like the Real Thing


Ingredients
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup egg whites
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup water
vanilla fudge swirl ice cream
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup unsalted peanuts

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Stand a thin hard cover book up
straight with the hard edge facing upwards. Drape a sheet of
parchment across the book (this is what you will use to
shape the shells). Line a plate with parchment paper. Heat
butter in a small saucepan over medium-low until melted, 2
to 3 minutes. Transfer the melted butter to a bowl, then
whisk in brown sugar, egg whites, vanilla to taste, and 1/2
teaspoon salt. Add flour and water. Whisk until the batter
is smooth and no clumps remain. Heat a non-stick skillet
over medium. Pour about 1 tablespoon batter into the pan;
spread into a thin layer with a spoon. Cook until browned on
the bottom and bubbles begin to form on top, 1 to 2 minutes.
Flip and cook until browned on other side, 1 to 2 minutes
more. Remove from pan and immediately drape over parchment-
lined book, pressing to help form that taco shell shape.
Transfer to a parchment-lined plate and repeat with
remaining batter. Let cool completely before filling.
Alternatively, preheat a waffle cone maker according to
manufacturer's instructions. Pour batter into the preheated
waffle maker and cook according to instructions. Remove from
pan and immediately drape across the parchment-lined book.
Let cool completely before filling. Remove ice cream from
the freezer and let soften for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile,
combine chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe
bowl; microwave in 30-second intervals, mixing well between
each, until mixture is melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in chopped peanuts. Carefully fill the taco shells with
the ice cream, pressing down gently to evenly distribute the
ice cream to the edges. Repeat with the remaining taco
shells. Place back on the parchment-lined plate. Dip the top
of each ice cream taco in the peanut-chocolate mixture to
completely coat the exposed ice cream. Return to the
parchment-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining tacos until
all are dipped. Once chocolate has hardened, carefully place
Choco Tacos in a sealable container or bag and return to
freezer.

ructions


banana pudding


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Separate eggs, placing the whites in the bowl of a stand
mixer and the yolks into a saucepan. Prepare the custard:
Add sugar, salt, and 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour to the
yolks. Splash in about 1/4 of the milk and start blending
mixture with a whisk. Pour in remaining milk and whisk until
smooth. Cook and stir mixture over medium heat until hot to
the touch, occasionally dipping your finger in to test.
Whisk constantly until custard is thick enough to form
ribbons. Remove custard from heat and add banana liqueur,
vanilla, then cold butter. Whisk until butter dissolves. Set
custard aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200
degrees C). Begin to assemble the pudding: Toss banana
slices with lemon juice. Spread 1/4 of the custard over the
bottom of a baking dish. Add a single layer of vanilla
wafers. Cover with 1/2 of the bananas and spread 1/2 of the
remaining custard on top. Add another layer of vanilla
wafers, using slightly fewer this time. Top with remaining
bananas and custard. Smooth the top and tap dish against the
counter to settle the pudding. Make the meringue topping:
Add cream of tartar to the egg whites. Beat using the whisk

cinnamon rolls


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then
remove from heat. Mix in the butter; stir until melted. Add
water and let cool until lukewarm. In a large bowl, combine
the milk mixture, yeast, white sugar, salt, eggs and 2 cups
flour; stir well to combine. Stir in the remaining flour,
1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When
the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8
minutes. Divide dough into two pieces. Roll each piece into
a 12x9 inch rectangle. In a bowl, stir together the cinnamon
and brown sugar. Spread each piece with half of the butter,
half of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. Roll up dough,
using a little water to seal the seam. Cut each roll into 12
slices using a very sharp knife or dental floss. Place rolls
onto two 9x13 inch greased baking pans. Cover and let rise
until almost doubled, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat oven
to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for
20 to 25 minutes until golden brown. To make frosting;
combine confectioner's sugar, cream cheese, butter and
vanilla. Add milk gradually until frosting reaches a
