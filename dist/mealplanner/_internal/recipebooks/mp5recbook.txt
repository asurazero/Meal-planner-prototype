Best Ever Cuban Sandwich


Ingredients
1/2 white onion
15 cloves garlic
3 oranges
3 limes
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 (5 pound) pork shoulder roast
1/4 cup butter, softened, divided
1 loaf Cuban bread,
2 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard
1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise
8 slices Swiss cheese
2 cups roast pork
12 ounces deli ham
12 sandwich-sliced refrigerated kosher dill pickles

Cooking Instructions

Prepare pork shoulder: Add onion, garlic, orange juice, lime
juice, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and salt into a food
processor or blender and process until smooth. Place pork in
the bottom of a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or large baking
dish and cut 3 or 4 large deep slits in the meat. Pour
marinade over pork, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator
4 hours or overnight. Place Dutch oven with prepared pork,
covered, in the oven and set the temperature to 325 degrees
F (165 degrees C). Bake until pork is very tender, 3 to 4
hours. Remove from the oven; rest 15 minutes. Remove pork to
a cutting board. Skim any fat from the cooking liquid, and
set cooking liquid aside. Shred pork with two forks, and
discard any remaining fat and bone. Return pork to the pot,
and add cooking liquid back into meat as needed to moisten.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat a
large skillet over medium heat. Spread about 2 tablespoons
softened butter over cut sides of bread and place bread,
buttered sides down, in skillet. Cook until buttered side is
lightly browned and toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir mustard
and mayonnaise together in a small bowl. Spread about 2
teaspoons mustard mixture over bottom halves of bread and
top with 1 slice of cheese, tearing as needed to fit the
bread without hanging over the edges. Using tongs or a
slotted spoon, add about 1/2 cup shredded pork to each
sandwich, draining off any excess liquid. Top each evenly
with ham, 3 pickle slices, and 1 cheese slice. Spread
remaining mustard mixture evenly over top pieces of bread
and place on top. Reheat the skillet over medium heat.
Spread about 1 tablespoon butter lightly on the outsides of
the 4 bottom buns. Working 2 sandwiches at a time, place
sandwiches, buttered side down, in skillet. Place 1 or 2
heavy-bottomed skillets on top of sandwiches to weigh them
down. Cook until toasted and lightly golden brown, 2 to 3
minutes. Remove weighted skillets. Spread remaining 1
tablespoon butter over the 4 top halves of sandwiches, flip
and press with weighted skillets again until toasted. Remove
the first 2 sandwiches from skillet; repeat the toasting
process with remaining sandwiches. Cut sandwiches in halves
and serve immediately.

combine grated onion with mayonnaise, 1/2 teaspoon salt,
sweet pickle relish, white vinegar, sugar, mustard, paprika,
and onion powder in a bowl and mix well. Set aside. Heat oil
in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook,
undisturbed for 3 minutes. Continue to cook, while crumbling
the meat with the back of a spoon and stirring occasionally,

Season with remaining salt, pepper, Worcestershire and
remaining chopped onions and cook for 1 minute. Remove from
the heat and stir in 2/3 cup of the sauce mixture and 1 1/3
cup cheese. Flip hashbrown patties over so the crispy side
is on top. Pour meat mixture over hash browns and top with
remaining shredded cheese. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and
until bubbly and cheese is melted, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove
from oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Top with shredded
lettuce and drizzle with remaining sauce. Top with chopped
pickles and serve immediately.

Cherry Cola Ribs


Ingredients
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons mustard
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons cherry cola
1 (3 pound) rack baby back ribs, membrane removed
1 1/2 cups cherry cola
2 tablespoons ketchup
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste

Cooking Instructions

For dry rub, whisk salt, smoked paprika, onion powder,
garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a
small bowl; set aside. For wet rub, whisk mustard, vinegar,
and 2 tablespoons cherry cola together in a small bowl; set
aside. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Line a sheet pan with a piece of foil long enough to extend
past the rack of ribs by at least 6 inches on both ends. Use
large size, heavy-duty foil if possible. Place the ribs,
meat side up, on the foil. Brush wet rub over top and sides,
and sprinkle about 60% of dry rub over the surface. Turn
ribs over and, with the bone side up, brush with wet rub,
then sprinkle with all the remaining dry rub. Reserve any
wet rub left at this point. Center the ribs lengthwise on
the foil, and bring up the ends of the foil, like a boat,
and crimp so any juices will stay inside. Crimp the two long
edges together over the top of the ribs. The foil doesn’t
have to be airtight, but the whole rack should be covered.
Bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours. Remove, open the
foil, and pour off juices that have accumulated in the foil
into a saucepan. Turn the rack meat side up, and brush with
wet rub. Enclose again in the foil, and continue to roast at
250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 1 hour. While meat is
cooking, add any remaining wet rub to the juices in the
saucepan, then add the 1 1/2 cups cherry cola, ketchup, and
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a simmer
on medium high, cook until liquid is reduced by half. Reduce
heat further, and simmer liquids very slowly until they
eventually thicken and become sauce-like. Once it is the
thickness of barbecue sauce, remove from heat entirely.
After one hour at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), remove ribs
from the oven, and open out the foil, pressing foil flat to
line the pan. Turn the oven temperature up to 300 degrees F
(150 degrees C). Brush ribs with sauce. Return ribs to the
oven for 15 minutes. Repeat this process, brushing ribs with
sauce every 15 minutes, until ribs are tender and come
easily off the bone, about 1 hour more. (See Note) Let ribs
rest for about 10 minutes. Slice between each rib with a
sharp knife, and serve with extra sauce.

Chicken and Orzo Bake


Ingredients
6 skinless boneless chicken thighs (1 1/2 pounds)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 cup onion
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons butter
1 pound dry orzo
3 cups chicken broth
1 (5 ounce) package baby spinach
4 ounces armesan cheese, shredded
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes
1 tablespoon lemon zest
2 tablespoons lemon juice
lemon wedges, for serving

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees
F (180 degrees C). Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt
and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 5- to 6-quart
Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half the chicken
thighs. Cook until seared and lightly browned, 4 to 5
minutes each side. Transfer browned chicken to a plate.
Repeat with remaining chicken. Reduce heat to medium. Add
remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to Dutch oven. Add onions.
Cook until tender and lightly browned, stirring

until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add butter to Dutch oven.
Once melted, add orzo, quickly stirring until fully coated
with butter. Carefully pour in chicken broth. Scrape bottom
of Dutch oven with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned
bits. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat. Bake, covered,
in the preheated oven until orzo has absorbed most of the
liquid, about 15 minutes. Remove Dutch oven from oven. Stir
in spinach, Parmesan, dried tomatoes, lemon zest, and lemon
juice. Nestle chicken thighs into orzo mixture. Cover,
return to the oven, and bake until chicken is no longer pink
at the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted near

Chili Dog Mac and Cheese


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound ground beef
1 large onion, diced
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
3 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican oregano
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup green peppers
1 pound hot dogs, sliced
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes (or 3 1/2 cups tomato sauce or puree)
2 1/2 cups water
2 cups elbow macaroni
8 ounces white Cheddar cheese
8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese
green onions, sliced, for the top (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Add olive oil to a large pot and place over high heat. Add
beef; cook and stir, breaking up with a spoon or spatula,
about 2 minutes. Add onions and salt, and cook, stirring,
until beef is crumbly, and onions turn translucent, about 5
minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper,
cinnamon, cayenne, dried oregano, and garlic. Cook,
stirring, for about 2 minutes. Add peppers, sliced hot dogs,
crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir together; bring the
mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer,
stirring occasionally, until cooked to your taste, at least
30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Once chili is nearly
ready, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring
to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil.
Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 1 minute less
than specified in package directions, until not quite
tender, and still firm to the bite, about 8 to 11 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees
C). Turn off heat under chili, drain macaroni, and add to
the pot of chili. Stir until combined, and transfer mixture
into a large, deep (15x10-inch) baking dish. Mix Cheddar and
Monterey Jack cheeses together in a bowl, and transfer about
60% of cheese to top of chili mixture. Use a spoon to
thoroughly mix cheese into the casserole. Apply remaining
cheese evenly over the top, and lightly poke down into the
surface with the tip of a spoon. Bake in the preheated oven
until bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before
serving, topped with green onions.

Grilled Chicken Meatballs


Ingredients
1 pound ground chicken
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon mirin
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/3 cup green onions
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoons bread crumbs
1 tablespoon ketchup
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
2 teaspoons fresh ginger
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
4 skewers

Cooking Instructions

Add chicken, sesame oil, soy sauce, mirin, salt, pepper,
cayenne, green onions, garlic, and bread crumbs to a bowl,
and use a fork to gently but thoroughly mix everything
together. Wrap and chill in the refrigerator for about 30
minutes before shaping. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F
(200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, and
lightly grease the foil. Divide meatball mixture into 16
portions (about 2 rounded tablespoons each), and transfer
onto the prepared pan. Using damp hands, roll each portion
into a smooth meatball; and space out evenly on the baking
sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Meatballs
will be just cooked through, and an instant read thermometer
inserted near the center will read 145 to 150 degrees F (63
to 66 degrees C). Let cool; wrap and keep in the
refrigerator until needed. These can be made the day before.
Preheat an outdoor grill, preferably charcoal, for medium
heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir ketchup, hoisin, fresh
ginger, and rice vinegar together in a small bowl, and set
aside. Place 4 meatballs on each skewer, and grill until
lightly charred and heated through, about 3 minutes per
side. Turn over, and brush with glaze. Turn back over, so
the brushed side is down, and let sear for about 30 seconds;
meanwhile, brush top with glaze. Turn over once more and let
sear for about 30 seconds; remove from the heat. Apply more
glaze after removing from the grill, as desired. Serve
immediately.

Grilled Tomahawk Steak


Ingredients
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon ontreal steak seasoning
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak
1/4 cup salted butter, at room temperature
1 tablespoon shallot
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chives
2 teaspoons steak rub

Cooking Instructions

To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak
seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small
airtight container; shake or stir to combine. Set aside 2
teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter. Place steak
on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and sides
with remaining steak rub until well coated. Place steak,
uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine overnight. For
compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and
the reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl. Mash
together with a fork until evenly combined. Spoon butter
into a small airtight container, cover, and refrigerate
until ready to use. Remove steak from the refrigerator 1
hour before cooking to take the chill off. It will cook on
the sheet pan that you used for dry-brining. Preheat the
oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). The reverse sear
method is used to cook this big steak, so you will need an
instant-read thermometer. If you are using a digital meat
thermometer, set the internal temperature to 110 degrees F
(43 degrees C). Bake steak on the sheet pan in the preheated
oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center reads 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), about 45 minutes.
Begin checking the temperature at 30 minutes. During the
last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time, preheat an outdoor
grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. When steak
reaches an internal temperature of 110 degrees F (43 degrees
C) measured with an instant-read thermometer, remove it from
the oven. Grill steak directly on the grates of the
preheated grill; sear on both sides, about 2 minutes per
side. This is a fatty piece of meat, so be mindful of flame
flare-ups. The internal temperature should now read 125 to
135 degrees F (51 to 57 degrees C) for medium rare. Remove
steak from the grill, and smear compound butter over top.
Let butter melt into the steak, heating up the fresh garlic,
shallots, and chives. Let steak rest for 10 minutes. Slice
steak and serve with accumulated juices and melted butter.
Be sure to serve the bone–someone will want to gnaw on it!

Hawaiian-Style Kalua Pork


Ingredients
1 4 1/2 pound) pork shoulder roast
4 teaspoons liquid hickory smoke
3 tablespoons sea salt
1 (!4 ounce) package banana leaves, thawed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place
pork in a large bowl and rub all over with liquid smoke.
Sprinkle salt over meat, and rub in until evenly coated. Set
aside. Place banana leaves on the counter, arranging them in
a spiral, overlapping pattern, so once pork is placed on the
leaves, they can be folded up and over to fully encase the
meat. Place pork on the center of leaves, fat side down, and
wrap the meat with the seams coming together at the top.
Once wrapped, pick up and invert the entire package, seam
side down, into a Dutch oven. Any extra banana leaves can be
tucked in around the sides. Bake, covered, in the preheated
oven for about 4 hours, or an instant-read thermometer
inserted near the center reads 195 to 200 degrees F (91 to
93 degrees C). Let pork rest in the Dutch oven for 30 to 60
minutes, then remove the meat to a bowl. Pull meat off the
bone, and set bone aside. Add any and all cooking liquids
and rendered fat into the bowl of pork. Use two forks to
shred meat as finely as you like. Taste for seasoning;
adjust with more salt or liquid smoke to taste. Arrange
banana leaves in the pot to make a nest for the meat.
Transfer shredded pork in and serve immediately.

Cooking Instructions

Pat steaks dry with paper towels; season on both sides with
sea salt. Place whole peppercorns on a wooden cutting board,
and crack peppercorns with an iron skillet or heavy pan.
Lightly pound peppercorns, then rub peppercorns in a
circular motion over the cutting board until pieces of
pepper are fairly uniform, and more coarse than ground black
pepper. Press cracked pepper into both sides of steaks; let
stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Heat butter
and olive oil in a 10-inch iron skillet over medium-high
heat. When butter stops sizzling and oil is hot, reduce heat
to medium and carefully add steaks to the hot oil. Cook
about 3 minutes per side, or until an instant-read
thermometer inserted near the center reads 120 degrees F (50
degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove steaks from pan; tent
with aluminum foil to keep warm. To the same skillet, over
medium-low heat, add minced shallots and cook until
softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and thyme sprigs; cook
until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Remove the pan from heat
and slowly and carefully pour in the cognac (adding cognac
over heat or adding too quickly could cause it to ignite).
Return the pan to the burner and stir to combine. Cook until
the liquid is evaporated. Stir in cream; continue cooking
until sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. To
serve, spread sauce on a serving platter. Slice steaks
thinly on the diagonal, and place on the sauce. Garnish with
additional thyme sprigs, if desired.

One-Pan Lemon Garlic Chicken and Asparagus


Ingredients
6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)
1 teaspoon talian seasoning, or any herb blend
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 cup chicken broth
1 pound asparagus,
1 tablespoon minced garlic, or to taste
1/2 lemon, juiced
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon parsley
1 lemon, sliced (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Pat chicken thighs dry and trim any excess fat. In a small
bowl, combine Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic powder,
salt, and pepper. Season both sides of chicken thighs with
herb mixture. In a large, nonstick skillet, heat olive oil
and 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. When oil is hot
and butter is melted, add chicken in a single layer and
brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove to a
plate and keep warm. Pour chicken broth into the skillet,
scraping up any browned bits, and bring to a boil. Boil
until broth is reduced in volume by half, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add asparagus and cook, stirring occasionally, until
asparagus is a deep, bright green color, 3 to 5 minutes. To
the asparagus, add fresh garlic and lemon juice and cook
about 1 minute. Add butter, one tablespoon at a time. Stir
quickly, until each pat is fully melted, before adding
another. Return chicken to the skillet, nestling the pieces
down into the sauce and asparagus. Sprinkle with minced
parsley and cook until the internal temperature of chicken,
measured with an instant-read thermometer, reads 165 degrees
F (74 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon sauce over the
chicken thighs to serve, and garnish with lemon slices.
Serve warm.

Pork Tenderloin with Peaches


Ingredients
3 slices bacon
1 (2 pound) package pork tenderloin
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
¾ teaspoon ground ginger, divided
1 ½ cups vertically sliced onion
1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
2 cups peeled and sliced fresh peaches
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons frozen orange juice concentrate
1 teaspoon fish sauce
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp,
about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
Reserve drippings in the skillet. Dry pork tenderloin with
paper towels and season both sides with salt, pepper, and
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger. Increase heat to medium-high and
brown tenderloin in the bacon drippings on all sides, 5 to 7
minutes. Removed browned tenderloin from skillet, transfer
to a plate, and keep warm. Reduce heat to medium. Add onion
slices to the same skillet and stir until onions are soft
and beginning to take on some color, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in
garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add sliced
peaches, chicken broth, orange juice concentrate, and
remaining ground ginger. Bring to a boil and return
tenderloin to the skillet. Pile peaches on top of the meat,
cover, reduce heat to simmer, and cook until pork is
slightly pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-
read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Arrange pork and peaches
on a serving platter. Meanwhile, combine fish sauce, water,
and cornstarch in a small bowl and stir until there are no
lumps. Increase heat to medium and bring skillet contents
back to a boil. Add cornstarch mixture to the liquid in the
skillet and stir quickly until sauce is bubbly and
thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over pork and
peaches. Crumble up cooked bacon and sprinkle over the
peaches. Garnish with parsley, if desired, and serve warm.

pinch cayenne
pinch of cumin
kosher salt
4 pork sausages
1 12 ounce) coleslaw mix
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon jalapeno pepper
1 lime, juiced
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon osher salt
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup reek yogurt
1 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon orcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons peppercorns
Kosher salt to taste
4 pita or naan, warmed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the
trimmed pork tenderloin on a plate or work surface. Combine
olive oil, grated garlic, red pepper flakes, cayenne, and
cumin in a small bowl. Rub the oil and spice mixture all
over the pork, coating the entire surface, then season
generously with Kosher salt. Preheat a coated cast-iron
skillet over medium-high heat, about 2 minutes. Add pork
tenderloin and cook until deeply golden brown, about 5
minutes. Flip tenderloin over and cook for an additional 3
minutes. Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and roast
for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, push tenderloin to one
side of the skillet and add the sausages. Roast for an
additional 10 minutes, flipping sausages halfway through,

pork will be enough to warm the bread. Split the sausages
down the center lengthwise. Carve the pork tenderloin into
1/4-inch thick slices. To assemble, place a warm piece of
pita or naan on a large plate. Set down 4 to 5 slices of
pork tenderloin, and add a sausage on top. place about 1

The Best Chimichangas


Ingredients
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup onion
3 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 cups plus 3 tablespoons water
1 chicken bouillon cube
1 (7 ounce) can green chiles
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups peanut oil or vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
8 (10 to 12-inch) flour tortillas
1 1/2 cups refried beans
1 (8 ounce) block pepper Jack cheese
shredded lettuce

Cooking Instructions

Sprinkle salt, pepper, and garlic powder evenly over one
side of the chicken breasts. Heat olive oil in a large deep
skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, seasoned side
down, into skillet, and cook, undisturbed, until browned, 3
to 4 minutes. Flip chicken over and push to one side of the
pan. Add onion, garlic, chili powder, and cumin to the
skillet and cook for 1 minute. Add 2 cups water and bouillon
and gently stir until well combined. Bring mixture to a
simmer. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently until chicken
is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about
20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the
center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove
chicken from pan and increase heat to medium-high; cook
until broth mixture is reduced by about half. Shred chicken
and add back to the pan, along with green chiles. Stir until
well combined and remove from heat. Whisk flour and
remaining water together in a small bowl until smooth; set
aside. Heat oil for frying in a large saucepan or Dutch oven
over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set
a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Place tortilla on
work surface and spread about 3 tablespoons beans in the
center. Top with 1/4 cup shredded cheese and 1/3 to 1/2 cup
well-drained shredded chicken. Brush flour mixture lightly
around edges of top half of tortilla. Fold sides of tortilla
in just over edges of filling and fold bottom of tortilla up
over filling. Press back on the tortilla to push the filling
tightly together and continue to roll upwards. Lightly press
the edges of the tortilla to seal tightly and set aside,
seam side down. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Carefully
place 2 burritos into hot oil and cook, turning
occasionally, until golden brown and toasted on the outside,
about 2 minutes. Drain on the prepared baking sheet. Bring
oil back up to temperature and repeat with remaining
burritos. Top as desired with warm queso, pico de gallo,
cilantro and shredded lettuce, or other toppings, and serve
immediately.

The Best Grilled Chicken Breasts


Ingredients
6 (6 ounce) boneless chicken breasts
1/4 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons lemon juice
3 cloves garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
oil or cooking spray
2 teaspoons kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Trim any excess fat from chicken. Place a piece of plastic
or parchment on top of each chicken breast on a solid, level

Air Fryer Smashed Potatoes


Ingredients
8 ounces baby gold potatoes
1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Meanwhile, place potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl: cook on
high until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer potatoes
to a baking sheet and use the bottom of a small glass to
gently "smash" them to 3/4 or 1/2-inch thick. The thinner
you flatten the potatoes, the crispier they will be. Brush
melted butter over the tops of smashed potatoes. Season with
salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Place potatoes in the
basket of the air fryer in an even layer; cook until golden
and crisp, about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve

Big Fat Fondant Potatoes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon miso paste
1 1/2 teaspoons dashi powder
6 large russet potatoes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2/3 cup chicken broth

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring
chicken broth to a simmer; whisk in miso and dashi. Turn off
the heat; set aside until needed. Turn potatoes onto
narrowest side; trim straight down to create a flat surface.
Turn and trim the other side with a straight cut parallel to
the first. Cut a little off each end to square the potato a
bit more, then make 2 angled cuts on each side of the
squared ends. Transfer to a bowl of cold water. Reserve
trimmings for another use. Drain, and dry with paper towels.
Place a large cast-iron pan or other heavy ovenproof skillet
on high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil; place potatoes in
skillet with largest flat side down. Season tops with half
the salt. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook until well
browned, about 4 minutes. Turn potatoes over and repeat, to
salt and brown the other side, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat
to medium, and use a paper towel to soak up excess oil
between potatoes in the pan. Add butter, and as it melts,
baste tops of potatoes with melted butter. Once butter has
toasted to a light brown color, turn off the heat and strain
in the miso dashi broth. Roast potatoes, uncovered, in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Remove and turn
potatoes over. Add the 2/3 cup plain chicken broth, and
return to the oven to continue roasting at 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C) until potatoes can be pierced very easily
with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes more. Check occasionally to
see if broth has evaporated; add more as needed. Brush tops
of potatoes with pan drippings, and serve.

Easy Fermented Pickled Veggies


Ingredients
3 cups water
3 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 pound VEGETABLES)
1 bunch HERBS)
2 teaspoons peppercorns
3 cloves garlic,

Cooking Instructions

To sanitize jar, put a 1-quart wide-mouthed canning jar in a
6- to 8-quart pot; cover with tap water. (You could also use
multiple smaller wide-mouthed canning jars.) Bring to a
boil; boil 10 minutes. Using tongs, carefully remove jar
from pot, draining excess water; let jar cool slightly.
Meanwhile, for brine, stir together filtered water and salt
in a 1-quart measuring cup until salt is dissolved. Add
radishes (or other VEGETABLES), mint (or other HERBS),
peppercorns (or other KICK), and garlic to jar. Veggies can
be packed tightly; they will shrink and soften as they
pickle. Fill jar with brine; you may have brine left over.
Add a fermenting weight or an inverted, sanitized plastic
lid to keep vegetables submerged. Cover jar with a kitchen
towel, securing with a rubber band. Let stand at room
temperature for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days. You’ll
start to see bubbles forming. The vegetables will become
more tart and the brine will become cloudier the longer the
pickles stand. Remove fermenting weight and screw on metal
lid. Chill up to 3 weeks.

Ingredients
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 tablespoon fresh ginger
1 1/4 teaspoons ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups basmati rice or other long grain white rice
3 cups water
1/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/3 cup sliced green onions (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Melt butter in a pan or pot with a tight-fitting lid over
medium heat. As soon as butter starts to bubble, add in
ginger, turmeric, cayenne, brown sugar, and salt. Cook,
whisking, for 1 minute. Add rice, and stir until every grain
is coated with butter. Stir in water, and bring to a boil
over high heat. As soon as it begins to boil, gently shake

reduce heat to medium-low. Cover tightly and simmer for 15
minutes. Turn off heat, and let rest, covered, for 10
minutes. DO NOT lift the lid or try to stir yet. Now, remove
the lid and use a fork to fluff and separate rice grains.

Roasted Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce


Ingredients
1 pound asparagus,
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 large egg yolks
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon water
1/2 cup butter
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
1 large hard boiled egg, peeled
1 tablespoon chives (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Place asparagus on
the prepared pan and drizzle olive oil over the spears.
Season with salt and pepper. Using clean hands, toss
asparagus spears until evenly coated with olive oil and
seasonings, then spread asparagus in a single layer on the
pan. Roast in the center of the preheated oven until fork-
tender, 10 to 12 minutes; thicker asparagus may require more
time. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, and water
together in a heavy saucepan or small skillet with a wire
whisk until well blended. Season with salt and pepper. Turn
heat to medium-low; and whisk continuously, being careful to
stir the entire bottom and sides of the pan, until eggs
begin to thicken slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. If eggs start to
curdle, remove pan from heat, and continue whisking briskly
and continuously until any lumps disappear. Gradually whisk
in hot melted butter, about a tablespoon at a time, whisking
briskly after each addition. Adjust salt and pepper, if
necessary, and stir in cayenne pepper. When whisking, each
stroke of the whisk should reveal the bottom of the pan. If
the sauce is too thick, whisk in a drop or two of water or
lemon juice. To serve, plate asparagus and pour Hollandaise
sauce on top. Grate hard-boiled egg over Hollandaise, and
garnish with snipped chives.

1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
6 slices bacon
1 onion
4 green onions, divided
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
4 ounces okra, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cloves garlic
2 tomatoes
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, or to taste (optional)
2 cups peanut oil or other vegetable oil for frying
3 large eggs
1 1/2 pounds shrimp,
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 green onions, thinly sliced
chopped parsley for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine water, milk, butter, and salt in a large saucepan
and bring just to a boil. Whisk in grits until incorporated.
Reduce heat to simmer, cover, and cook until thick, 25 to 30
minutes, stirring often. If mixture gets too thick, add a
little more milk or water. Cut kernels off corn cobs, and
using the back of the knife, carefully scrape the cob to
release the creamy corn milk. Stir corn kernels and corn
milk into grits and continue cooking until grits are creamy
and tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer, stirring often. Stir in
pepper and adjust seasonings if necessary. Meanwhile, heat a
large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add olive
oil and bacon slices in a single layer, and cook until bacon
is crisp, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Remove
bacon from the skillet, drain on paper towels, and set
aside. Crumble bacon once cool enough to handle. Reserve
drippings in the skillet and return skillet to medium-high
heat. Finely slice green onions and reserve green ends for
garnish. Add white parts of green onion, onion, green and
red bell peppers, and okra to the skillet and cook until
softened and lightly browned, stirring often, about 5
minutes. Add in salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne and
cook for 1 minute. Add fresh tomatoes and garlic, and cook
for 2 minutes. Add butter to mixture and allow it to melt.
Sprinkle flour over skillet and cook, stirring constantly,
about 1 minute. Add in tomatoes, with juices, and stock
while stirring constantly until smooth. Stir in sugar,
Worcestershire, and hot sauce, and return mixture to a
simmer. Cook gravy for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Heat peanut oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large,
deep skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs in a bowl;
add shrimp and stir to coat. In a shallow dish, whisk flour,
salt, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Working a
few at a time, remove shrimp from egg, allowing excess to
drip off, and lightly coat in flour mixture. Transfer shrimp
to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with
remaining shrimp. Working in batches, add shrimp to hot oil
and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned and
crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on a wire rack set over a paper
towel-lined baking sheet. To serve, place grits in the
bottom of a shallow bowl. Top with about 1/2 cup of gravy
and 6 to 8 shrimp. Top with crumbled bacon, and sprinkle
with green onions and parsley if desired.

asparagus


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over
medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper
towel-lined plate. Crumble bacon when cool; set aside.
Reserve 1 tablespoon of bacon drippings. Melt butter with
drippings in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir
celery and onion in the saucepan until onion is translucent,
about 4 minutes. Whisk flour into the mixture and cook for 1
minute. Whisk in chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add
potato and chopped asparagus stalks, reserving the asparagus
tips for later. Season with salt and ground black pepper.
Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Pour the soup into a
blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold
down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and
carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get
the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in
batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately,
you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the
cooking pot. Cook and stir mushrooms and asparagus tips in
the same skillet used for bacon until mushrooms give up
their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and ground
black pepper, if needed. Stir mushrooms, asparagus tips, and
half-and-half cream to pureed soup. Cook until thoroughly
heated. Garnish soup with crumbled bacon.

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Season pork chops with salt and

release method, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Slice potatoes along their tops and serve with pork chops
and carrots.

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place

stirring occasionally, until lightly browned but still soft,
about 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Set

Air Fryer Cinnamon Roll Bites


Ingredients
1 (12.4 ounce) cinnamon rolls
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon orange peel
1 tablespoon orange juice
icing

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Add sugar and
cinnamon to a large resealable plastic bag, and shake to
combine. Remove the 8 cinnamon rolls from the can, and set
icing aside. Cut each roll into 4 equal pieces for a total
of 32 bites. Line the fryer basket with parchment paper.
Place the bites in a single layer in the bottom of the
basket, cook for 3 minutes, turn over using tongs, and cook
until golden brown, another 2 to 3 minutes. Depending on the
brand and size of your air fryer, you may have to cook in
batches, and your timing may vary, so watch closely.
Meanwhile, prepare the dip. Add cream cheese, confectioner’s
sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and the packaged icing to
a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed
until you reach a dipping consistency, about 1 minute. Drop
the warm pieces into the sugar-cinnamon mixture, and shake.
Transfer to a plate or basket, and serve with the dip.

Banana Bread Brownies


Ingredients
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 ounces dark chocolate, broken into pieces
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 large egg
2 bananas, mashed (about 1 cup)
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
12 slices banana (optional)
2 tablespoons white sugar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Generously butter a 9x9-inch square pan. A piece of
parchment paper can also be added to the bottom of the pan
to prevent sticking. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Melt chocolate
in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second
intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an
electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg, vanilla, and
mashed banana, and beat until combined. Add chocolate, and
beat until mixture is well combined and smooth. Use a
spatula to mix in walnuts and chocolate chips, then use the
spatula to mix in flour just until flour disappears.
Transfer batter into the prepared pan and smooth top. Place
banana slices on top, evenly spaced in a grid pattern. Bake
in the preheated oven until a skewer comes out almost clean
but with some batter on the very tip. If you want fudgier
brownies, do not overcook. Let brownies cool in the pan.
Cover, refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour, and serve
chilled. For optional banana brûlée: While brownies are
cooling, cover each banana slice with a half teaspoon of
sugar. Use a propane kitchen torch to melt the sugar until
dark brown and bubbling. Be careful not to char the edges of
the crust around the banana too much. This banana brûlée
step can also be done before the brownies go into the oven.

Classic Glazed Doughnuts


Ingredients
⅓ cup milk
⅓ cup cake flour
1 cup milk
4 ¼ cups cake flour, plus more for dusting
1 package active dry yeast
5 ounces evaporated milk
½ cup butter, melted and cooled
2 large eggs
¼ cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups vegetable oil for frying
3 cups powdered sugar
½ cup melted butter
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
⅛ teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons hot water

Cooking Instructions

For tangzhong, whisk together 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup cake
flour in a small saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, over
medium heat until a very thick paste forms, about 3 minutes
(watch constantly—it thickens quickly). Cool briefly. Heat 1
cup milk in a second saucepan to 105 degrees F to 115
degrees F (40 degrees C to 46 degrees C). Transfer warm milk
to the bowl of a stand mixer; stir in yeast and let stand
for 5 minutes. Add evaporated milk, melted butter, eggs,
sugar, salt, vanilla, the cooled tangzhong, and 2 cups cake
flour to the stand mixer. Using the paddle attachment, beat
at low speed until mixture is smooth, about 3 minutes.
Gradually beat in remaining 2 1/4 cups cake flour to make a
soft dough. Continue beating at low speed until dough is
smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Dough will be soft. Turn dough out
onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth, 2
to 3 minutes, adding 2 to 4 tablespoons additional cake
flour. Be careful not to add too much flour. (If dough
begins to stick to surface, use a bench scraper to lift
dough from surface and add a dusting of flour. If your dough
is too soft to knead, chill covered for 2 hours or up to
overnight before kneading.) Shape dough into a ball.
Transfer to a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease
surface; cover. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in
size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough and turn out onto
floured surface. Roll dough into a 10x15-inch rectangle
about 1/2-inch thick. If dough springs back, let it rest an
additional 10 minutes. Lightly flour 2 large baking sheets.
Cut dough using 3-inch and 1-inch round cutters to create
doughnuts and doughnut holes. Arrange cutouts 1 inch apart
on the prepared baking sheets. Cover with a towel and let
cutouts rise in a warm place until very light and fluffy,
about 1 hour. [If you have scraps, gently knead together,
being careful not to overwork dough; let rest 10 minutes
before cutting.] Arrange wire racks in two 10x15-inch rimmed
baking pans (one for cooling, one for finished glazed
doughnuts). About 20 minutes before doughnuts are done
rising, pour oil to a depth of 2 1/2 to 3 inches into a
large skillet or a deep-fat fryer. Heat to 365 degrees F
(185 degrees C). Working in batches of 2 to 3 doughnuts,
fry, turning once halfway through, until golden, about 90
seconds. Transfer to prepared cooling rack to cool slightly.
Repeat with remaining doughnuts. For doughnut holes, working
in batches, fry, constantly moving with a slotted spoon,
until evenly golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to prepared
rack to cool slightly. Whisk together powdered sugar, melted
butter, vanilla extract and salt in a bowl to make the
vanilla glaze. Whisk in hot water, 1 tablespoon at a time,
until desired consistency. If glaze thickens, stir in
additional hot water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Dip warm
doughnuts and doughnut holes into vanilla glaze, turning to
coat both sides. Arrange doughnuts on the second prepared
rack to allow glaze to set, about 30 minutes.

Copycat Texas Roadhouse Rolls


Ingredients
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 oz. dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg yolk
2 large eggs
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
cooking spray
1 tablespoon water
cinnamon Honey Butter

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Heat milk in a small saucepan over
medium heat, stirring occasionally, until just bubbling
around the edges, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour
into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook
attachment. Stir in sugar and 4 tablespoons butter; let
cool, stirring occasionally, until mixture is between 110
degrees F and 120 degrees F (43 degrees C and 48 degrees C)
about 10 minutes. Stir in yeast; let stand until mixture is
foamy, about 10 minutes. Add salt, egg yolk, 1 egg, and 1/2
of the flour; beat on low speed until combined, about 1
minute. Still on low speed, carefully add remaining flour,
1/2 cup at a time, and beat until dough just comes together,
about 1 minute. Dough will be very sticky and wet. Increase
speed to medium, and beat until dough pulls away from sides
of bowl and dough is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.
Coat a large bowl with cooking spray; transfer dough to
prepared bowl. Cover loosely and let rise in a warm place
until about doubled in size, about 1 hour. With a clean
hand, punch down dough and turn dough out onto a lightly
floured work surface. Press or roll dough out into a
rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Trim edges with a sharp
knife to create a perfect 16- x 8-inch rectangle. Starting
at one long end, fold dough in half to form a 16- x 4-inch
rectangle; pinch to close dough halves together. Use a sharp
knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into 16 (2-inch) squares.
Place dough squares onto a parchment paper-lined baking
sheet about 1/2-inch apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap;
set aside at room temperature until about doubled in size, 1
hour. (It’s okay if the baking sheet looks a little
crowded.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk together remaining egg and water until combined. Brush
tops of rolls with egg wash. Bake in preheated oven until
golden brown, 12 to 16 minutes. Microwave remaining 2
tablespoons butter on HIGH until melted, about 30 seconds.
Immediately brush rolls with melted butter. Serve warm with
Cinnamon Honey Butter.

2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, plus leaves for garnish
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, smashed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 14.1 ounce) package flatbreads
2 cups shredded fontina cheese
1 cup shredded cooked chicken
1/2 cup kalamata and/or green olives
black pepper, for garnish

Cover with plastic wrap or a tea towel; let stand until cool
enough to handle, 20 to 30 minutes. Peel and discard skins.
You should have about 2 cups roasted peppers. Reduce oven
temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). For sauce,
blend roasted peppers, almonds, oil, chopped basil, lemon
juice, garlic, and salt in a blender or food processor until
smooth. Remove and discard foil from baking sheets. Arrange
1 flatbread on each baking sheet. Spread each flatbread with
1/2 cup sauce, spreading to 1/2 inch from edges. Reserve
remaining sauce for another use. Top evenly with cheese,
chicken, and olives. Bake until cheese is melted and edges
are browned, 8 to 9 minutes. For a crispier crust, bake
topped flatbreads 6 to 7 minutes directly on oven rack
instead of on baking sheets. Garnish with black pepper and
additional basil. Cut each flatbread into 6 slices.

Panettone


Ingredients
⅓ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
4 cups all-purpose flour
½ cup warm milk
⅔ cup white sugar
4 large eggs
2 large egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
12 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cups candied mixed fruit
2 ½ teaspoons grated lemon zest
2 tablespoons orange zest
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon cream
3 (7 x 4-inch) round paper panettone molds

Cooking Instructions

To make sponge, warm a small bowl by rinsing it with hot
water. Pour in warm water and sprinkle 1 package yeast on
it. Let stand until yeast has dissolved. Stir in 1/2 cup
flour, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand 30 minutes, or
until doubled. Sprinkle remaining yeast over warm milk. Let
stand until dissolved. Beat together sugar, eggs, egg yolks,
and vanilla. Stir in milk-yeast mixture. Add sponge and stir
until well incorporated. Combine butter and remaining 3 ½
cups flour until crumbly. Slowly pour in egg mixture and
beat on high speed 3 to 4 minutes, until dough is elastic
looking and long strands form. Beat in fruit and zests. Turn
dough into oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and leave in
a warm place to rise until doubled, about 2 to 3 hours.
Brush inside of three 7 x 4-inch paper molds with melted
butter. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface
and knead a few times to deflate. Divide dough into 3
pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and drop into prepared
molds; place on a baking sheet about 4-inches apart and
cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place
until doubled again, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400
degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut an X in top of each loaf with
oiled scissors. Combine egg yolk with cream. Brush tops of
loaves lightly with egg wash. Place baking sheet with loaves
in bottom 1/3 of preheated oven. After 10 minutes, lower
heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Continue to bake for
30 more minutes; if tops get too brown, cover with foil.
Loaves are done when a wooden skewer inserted into centers
comes out clean. Cool on wire rack.

Perfect Pan Pizza


Ingredients
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 cup water
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
6 ounces part skim mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup pizza sauce (see below)
1/3 cup pepperoni

Cooking Instructions

Whisk flour, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir
water and 1 tablespoon olive oil together in a separate bowl
or measuring cup and add to flour mixture. Stir just until
well combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let stand at
room temperature until dough has tripled in size, 8 to 12
hours. Alternatively, cover and refrigerate at least 12
hours and up to 36 hours, or until dough has tripled in
size. Uncover dough and transfer to a floured surface.
Gently stretch and fold dough over a few times until nearly
smooth; use your hands to lightly shape dough into a ball.
Dough should remain a little sticky. Pour remaining olive
oil into a 12-inch cast iron skillet and use your fingers to
liberally coat the bottom and sides of the skillet. Using
oiled hands, transfer dough to the skillet, gently flatten
into a thick disc shape, and lightly coat with some of the
oil. Lightly cover the skillet with plastic wrap and set
aside at room temperature for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to
400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Use fingers to lightly press
dough to an even layer to the edges of the pan and about 1/2
inch up the sides. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese around the edges
and over dough. Sprinkle 1/3 cup shredded mozzarella over
dough. Spread pizza sauce in an even layer over entire
crust. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top with
pepperoni. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden
around the edges and cheese is lightly browned and melted,
20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on the
stove over medium heat. Cook until bottom of crust is golden
brown and toasted, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully slide pizza
from the pan to a wire rack; let stand for 10 minutes.
Transfer pizza to a cutting board; slice and serve.

Sausage Gravy Kolaches


Ingredients
1/2 cup milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
1 package dry yeast
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 large egg
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour, plus more as needed
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
8 ounces ground pork breakfast sausage (or sausage links with casings removed)
1 1/2 teaspoons all purpose flour
4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
4 green onions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish
2 tablespoons milk
2 sage leaves, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne
1 large egg, beaten, divided

Cooking Instructions

Combine warm milk, yeast, sugar, salt, and melted butter in
the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attached. Add
egg and flour. Drop down dough hook and start kneading on
low speed, stopping and scraping down the sides every so
often in the beginning to make sure all the ingredients are
incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Once everything has come
together, increase speed 1 notch and continue kneading until
dough is very soft, very smooth, and slightly elastic, about
2 minutes. Transfer dough onto a work surface, knead for 1
minute, and shape into a smooth ball. Since the dough has
butter in it, it won’t be sticky. Return dough ball to a
lightly buttered bowl. Cover, and allow to rise in a warm
spot until it has doubled in size, about 90 minutes. Once
dough is risen, transfer to a work surface and punch down to
de-gas. Shape back into a ball, and weigh on a digital
scale. Divide amount by 8 and weigh out 8 equal dough
portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball, using just
enough flour to keep it from sticking. Press and flatten the
dough into a disc about 3 1/2-inches wide and a 1/2-inch
thick. Shape with your hands to make a small indention in
the middle. Transfer to a silpat-lined baking sheet. Cover
and let proof until almost doubles in size, 45 to 60
minutes. Combine cooled sausage, cream cheese, green onions,
milk, sage, ½ of the beaten egg, salt, pepper, and cayenne
in a bowl. Mix filling into a thick paste with a spoon.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) Use
slightly damp fingertips to press a well into the center of
each kolache to place the filling. Be sure to leave no more
that 3/4-inch of un-pressed dough around the outside. Do not
press all the way through the dough to the baking sheet.
Brush each kolache with remaining egg wash. Fill evenly with
the sausage cream cheese mixture. Bake in the preheated oven
until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven,
transfer to a wire rack, and allow to rest for 10 to 15
minutes before serving. Top with sliced green onions for
garnish.

Semla (Swedish Fat Tuesday Buns)


Ingredients
1 cup warm milk (95-100 degrees F)
1 package active dry yeast (2 teaspoons)
1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
2 cups all-purpose flour
7 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
⅔ cup powdered sugar
1 large egg
2 ½ teaspoons ground cardamom
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg
1 teaspoon water
14 ounces almond paste
½ cup powdered sugar
⅓ cup milk, or as needed to achieve desired texture
1 teaspoon ground cardamom, or to taste
1 ½ cups heavy cream, whipped
2 tablespoons powdered sugar for dusting

Cooking Instructions

Pour milk into the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle yeast on
top, followed by 1 1/3 cups flour and mix with a wooden
spoon. Allow to stand until foamy, about 20 minutes. Add
flour, softened butter, powdered sugar, egg, cardamom, and
salt; knead with dough hook (or by hand) until a soft,
smooth, elastic dough forms, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer dough
to a lightly floured surface and shape into a ball. Divide
into 12 equal portions. Using flour as necessary, roll dough
under a cupped hand to form perfectly smooth balls. Place
dough balls evenly on a parchment lined baking sheet,
leaving space in between and slightly push down. Dust tops
with flour, and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let rise
in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Preheat
the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Stir together egg
and water in a small bowl and brush rolls all over with egg
wash. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about
12 minutes. Transfer buns onto a wire rack and let cool
completely. Combine almond paste, powdered sugar, milk, and
cardamom in a food processor and blend almond filling until
smooth. Cut a triangle from the top of the buns, and remove
some of the crumbs to make room for the filling. Pipe almond
filling into each bun, and top with whipped cream. Place the
triangle on top and dust with powdered sugar before serving.

Sour Cream Donuts


Ingredients
2 ¼ cups bleached cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
¾ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
⅔ cup sour cream, room temperature
½ cup granulated sugar
2 large egg yolks, room temperature
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
vegetable oil as needed for frying
4 ½ cups powdered sugar
½ cup unsalted butter, melted
6 tablespoons hot water
1 ½ teaspoons light corn syrup
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon
together in a bowl until well combined. Whisk sour cream,
granulated sugar, egg yolks, melted butter, oil, and vanilla
together in a large bowl until well combined. Gradually fold
flour mixture into sour cream mixture just until combined.
(Dough will be quite soft and sticky.) Cover, and chill in
the refrigerator until dough is cold and just slightly
firmed, about 2 hours. Turn dough out onto a heavily-floured
surface and pat or roll to 3/8- to 1/2-inch thickness,
flouring hands or rolling pin as needed. Cut dough using a
floured 3 ½-inch round cutter. Cut holes in the center of
the dough circles using a floured 1 ¼-inch round cutter.
Transfer dough rings to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Reroll, and cut dough scraps, repeating process as needed.
Heat 3 inches of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat
until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F to 365
degrees F (182 degrees C to 185 degrees C). Fry 1 to 2
donuts at a time until golden brown and cooked through,
about 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side, adjusting heat as necessary
to maintain oil temperature. Transfer donuts to a baking
sheet lined with paper towels using a spider strainer. Let
drain, and cool for 5 minutes (see note). Whisk together
powdered sugar, melted butter, hot water, corn syrup, salt,
and vanilla in a large bowl for the glaze until smooth and
well combined. Place 1 warm donut in the powdered sugar
mixture, craggy side up; use a spoon to coat donut
completely in the glaze. Remove donut from glaze using two
forks placed underneath; let excess drip off, and then
transfer donut to a wire rack placed over a rimmed baking
sheet. Repeat with remaining donuts and glaze. Let donuts
stand until glaze is set before serving, about 25 minutes.

Strawberry Lemon Cheesecake Rolls


Ingredients
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 (1/4-ounce) active dry yeast
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 large eggs
1/3 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest, divided
1 3/4 cups strawberry preserves
3/4 cup cheesecake filling
1/3 cup lemon curd
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. In a small saucepan, heat 1 cup of
the milk to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C) over low heat,
about 5 minutes. Pour warm milk into a liquid measuring cup,
and stir in sugar and yeast; let sit until foamy, about 5
minutes. Beat flour, eggs, butter, salt, and 1 teaspoon of
the lemon zest with a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook
attachment on medium speed until crumbly, about 1 minute.
With mixer on low speed, slowly stream in milk mixture until
fully combined, then increase speed to medium-low, and beat
until a smooth dough forms, 8 to 12 minutes. If needed, add
more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough is too sticky.
Transfer dough to a greased 13- x 9-inch baking pan, cover,
and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1
hour. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface;
roll into a 18- x 15-inch rectangle (about 1/4 inch thick).
Spread 1 1/2 cups of the preserves evenly over bottom two-
thirds of the dough starting on 1 long side, leaving a
1/2-inch border. Carefully roll dough into a log starting at
long side with with preserves. Some of the preserves may
spill out as you roll, that’s okay. Slice dough log into 12
rolls, and arrange, cut sides down, back into greased baking
pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place, until doubled in
size, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden
brown, about 25 minutes. Brush remaining 1/4 cup preserves
evenly over rolls. Let cool slightly at room temperature,
about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together cheesecake
filling, lemon curd, lemon juice, remaining 3 tablespoons
milk, and remaining 1 teaspoon lemon zest in a medium bowl
until combined. Drizzle desired amount of lemon curd mixture
over warm rolls. Serve any remaining lemon curd mixture on
the side.

Triple Coffee Sweet Rolls


Ingredients
1/4 cup espresso powder
2 cups milk,
2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon espresso powder
1 tablespoon cocoa
1 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar
3 tablespoons espresso or strong coffee, or more as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine 1/4 cup instant espresso and hot milk in the bowl of
a stand mixer, and let cool until just warm to the touch,
about 95 degrees F (35 degrees C). Add yeast, egg, white
sugar, salt, and 6 tablespoons melted butter. Add most of
the flour, attach the dough hook, and knead on low speed
until everything comes together and begins to pull away from
the sides of the bowl. Turn mixer speed up a notch, and
continue to knead until a smooth, soft, elastic dough forms,
adding in remaining flour as needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove
dough from the mixer, form into a ball, and place back in
the bowl. Cover and let it rise in a warm place until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, make filling. Melt
1/2 cup butter in a small pan over medium heat. Stir in
brown sugar, cocoa, and 1 tablespoon instant espresso
powder. Once combined, remove from heat and let cool. As
soon as butter starts to cool and solidify, stir to form a
thick, spreadable paste. Reserve until needed. Once dough
has risen, use your hands to press out the air, and reshape
into a ball. For best results, transfer dough to a plastic
bag and place in the refrigerator overnight. Dough can be
used right away if need be. Very lightly flour a work
surface. Turn dough out onto the work surface, press into a
rectangle, and very lightly dust the top with flour. Roll
out into a 12x18-inch rectangle. Spread filling evenly to
the edges, leaving a few inches along one of the long sides
free of filling. Lightly brush exposed dough with water;
this will help to seal the seam. Beginning with the long
side that has filling, roll dough and filling toward the
long side with exposed dough to form a uniform log,
finishing with the seam on the bottom. Generously butter a
9x12- or 13-inch baking dish or pan, and, if desired, line
the bottom with buttered parchment. Score the log of dough
into 12 equal portions, and then cut each portion with a
piece of string as shown. Place cut rolls into the prepared
pan. Cover rolls and leave to rise in a warm spot until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375
degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until
puffed, golden brown at the edges, and an instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center, reads 200 degrees F
(95 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes
before icing. Whisk together confectioner’s sugar with 3 to
4 tablespoons of espresso or strong coffee, or enough to
form an icing that can be drizzled over with a spoon.
Drizzle icing over rolls and let cool before serving, or
enjoy slightly warm.

cheddar biscuits


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Combine mozzarella cheese and cream cheese in a large
microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave on high power
until slightly melted, about 45 seconds. Remove from
microwave and stir. Repeat, heating for about 20 seconds
more. Remove from microwave again and stir; consistency
should be very sticky and cheese should be completely
melted. Return to microwave, if necessary, until all cheese
is melted. Mix almond flour, eggs, baking powder, and garlic
powder together in a bowl. Add mixture to the large bowl
with melted cheese and mix well. Add Cheddar cheese and stir
into the dough. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on a flat
surface and dust lightly with almond flour. Pour dough onto
the middle of the plastic wrap and roll up to form a ball.
Place in the refrigerator until slightly hardened, 20 to 30
minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Grease a dark baking sheet with butter. Remove dough from
the refrigerator and cut into 8 equal-sized pieces. Roll
each into a ball and place on the prepared baking sheet,
spacing equally and avoiding the sides, as biscuits will
spread while cooking. Bake in the preheated oven until
golden brown, checking at 10 minutes. Remove from oven
immediately and cool completely before serving, about 15
minutes.

 Pomegranate


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Score pomegranate rinds lengthwise and crosswise with a
knife. Carefully crack open with the knife. Break flesh into
quarters with your hands, using scored lines as a guide.
Hold each quarter over a large bowl and whack firmly with a
wooden spoon to release seeds. Mash seeds in the bowl with a
potato masher to release some juice. Add sugar and lemon
juice; continue mashing to release more juice. Beat egg
whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with an electric
mixer until stiff peaks form. Mash into the pomegranate
mixture in the bowl. Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal
bowl with an electric mixer until thick. Mash into the
pomegranate mixture, popping seeds to reach desired
consistency. Pour mixture into freezer-safe containers.
Freeze until firm, about 2 hours.

Roasted Butternut Squash Salad


Ingredients

1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
6 slices bacon
1 cup sliced onion
8 cups chopped romaine lettuce
⅓ cup pecans, toasted and chopped
⅓ cup raisins
2 tablespoons maple syrup, or to taste

Air Fryer Spinach


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Make filling: Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium
heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3
minutes. Add bell pepper and mushrooms; cook, stirring
occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Remove from
heat and stir in spinach and garlic; continue stirring until
spinach is slightly wilted. Season with Italian seasoning,
salt, and pepper. Let cool for 10 minutes. Stir in feta
cheese, breaking up any large pieces. Prepare chicken: Pat
chicken dry and place on a cutting board. Cut a pocket in
each breast by inserting a knife into the thickest part of
the breast and slicing parallel to the cutting board,
leaving about 1 inch at each tip. Be careful not to cut all
the way through the thinnest edge of the breast. Preheat an
air fryer to 370 degrees F (190 degrees C) if preheating is
recommended by the manufacturer. Separate prosciutto slices
and place onto a clean surface. Place 2 tablespoons filling
onto each slice; roll prosciutto around filling to create an
oblong bundle. Tuck one bundle into each sliced chicken
breast and close the opening with a few toothpicks. Place
beaten egg into a shallow bowl. Combine Parmesan cheese,
bread crumbs, parsley, salt, and pepper in another shallow
bowl. Dip each stuffed chicken breast into beaten egg, then
dredge in bread crumb mixture. Spray both sides with cooking
spray and place into the air fryer basket. Cook chicken in
the preheated air fryer until browned, about 15 minutes per
side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
of meat should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Crescent Breakfast Squares


Ingredients
2 12x16-inch parchment paper sheets
2 (12 ounce) packages crescent roll dough (such as Pillsbury® Grands!™)
8 slices deli ham
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or more to taste
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
½ cup diced onion
½ cup diced red bell pepper
10 large eggs
1 tablespoon half-and-half cream or heavy whipping cream
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
8 slices Swiss cheese
1 tablespoon bagel seasoning (such as Trader Joe's® Everything But the Bagel Seasoning Blend)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread each
sheet of parchment on a work surface. Unroll crescent dough,
and place the contents of one can on each sheet. Roll dough
into two 10x15-inch rectangles, making sure the perforations
are sealed, one rectangle per parchment. Slide one dough
rectangle with its parchment paper onto a 13x18-inch sheet
pan; reserve the second rectangle for later use. Working
with the first piece of dough, spread ham slices over the
dough, leaving about 1/2-inch on all sides. Spread Dijon
mustard in a thin layer over the ham slices. Melt 1
tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook
and stir onions and bell peppers until slightly softened,
about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low; add 1 tablespoon
butter to skillet with vegetables until melted. Whisk eggs,
half-and-half or cream, salt, and pepper together in a large
bowl until well blended. Pour egg mixture into the skillet
with vegetables. Cook, using a spatula to lift and move,
until eggs are just set and still wet looking. Spoon lightly
cooked egg mixture in an even layer over the ham slices,
maintaining the 1/2-inch dough border all around. Place
sliced Swiss cheese in a single layer over the eggs. Place
the second dough rectangle over all, using the parchment to
help you align it. Carefully peel off the parchment. Moisten
fingertips and press the edges of the two dough rectangles
together, then use a fork to crimp. Melt remaining 1
tablespoon butter; brush over the top of the dough with a
pastry brush. Sprinkle bagel seasoning over all. Bake in the
preheated oven until nicely browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove to cool on a wire rack for about 15 minutes. Slice
into serving pieces with a sharp knife.

1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water

Strawberry Rhubarb Drop Biscuits


Ingredients
1 1/4 cups rhubarb
1 1/4 cups strawberries
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stick unsalted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons fruit syrup
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 large egg (optional)
2 teaspoons water (optional)
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into
1/4-inch pieces; place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries
and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss to combine, cover, and let
fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Combine
flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing
bowl; whisk to combine. Drain fruit in a strainer set over a
bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices that pass through. Grate
frozen butter into the flour mixture, while stirring with a
fork several times to coat butter pieces with flour. Add 1/4
cup sugar, and drained fruit, mixing with a fork until fruit
is coated with flour. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved
fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk. Mix with a fork just
until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough.
If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little
more buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a
little more flour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230
degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat. Scoop or
spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking
sheet. Whisk together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush
biscuits with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack
and let cool completely. Mix powdered sugar, lemon zest, and
lemon juice together in a small bowl for the lemon icing.
Fill icing into a piping bag or a plastic bag with the tip
cut off and drizzle icing over cooled biscuits.

1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/3 cup half and half

omelets


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Add eggs to a bowl, along with water, soy sauce, mirin,
salt, sugar, and cayenne. Use a fork to beat eggs until
whites are completely incorporated. Transfer egg mixture
into a pourable measuring cup. Set a 10-inch non-stick pan
over medium heat. Mix sesame and vegetable oil in a small
bowl, and use a brush to oil the pan. Pour in 1/3 of egg
mixture. Tilt the pan to cover the bottom with eggs. Cook
until omelet is about halfway set, then use a spatula to
turn over about 1 inch of edge toward the center on 3 sides
to square the shape on those 3 sides. If eggs seem to be
cooking too fast, reduce heat to medium-low. Use a spatula
to roll the omelet toward the rounder side, to form a
rectangular roll, about 2 inches wide by 8 inches long.
Slide omelet over to about 3 inches from the edge of the
pan, and brush more oil over the pan surface. Pour the
second 1/3 of eggs around the omelet. Lift omelet slightly
with the spatula so that some eggs flow underneath. Raise
heat back to medium, if it was reduced. When egg layer is
halfway set, use a spatula to roll this layer up and over
the already-folded omelet in the pan, and continue to roll
into a rectangle. Add remaining 1/3 of egg mixture, and
repeat cooking and rolling steps to make the final layer.
Transfer omelet onto plastic wrap, and use it to shape the
omelet, before wrapping and rolling it into a tight package;
cover with a towel and let rest for 5 minutes. Unwrap, slice
into 6 or 8 pieces, and serve on a warm plate. Sprinkle with
furikake.

Chocolate-Glazed Hazelnut Mousse Cake


Ingredients
2 tablespoons hazelnuts, toasted and skins rubbed off
3 tablespoons sugar
½ cup all-purpose flour
¼ cup unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
⅛ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
3 tablespoons cold water
½ cup chocolate hazelnut spread such as Nutella
½ cup mascarpone
1 ½ cups chilled heavy cream
2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
3 tablespoons sugar
5 tablespoons heavy cream
3 ½ ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), chopped

Cooking Instructions

For shortbread base: Put oven rack in middle position and
preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Invert bottom of springform
pan (to make it easier to slide shortbread base off bottom),
then lock on side of pan and line bottom with a round of
parchment paper. Pulse hazelnuts with sugar in a food
processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add flour, butter,
cocoa, and salt and pulse just until a dough forms. Press
dough evenly onto bottom of springform pan with your
fingers. Prick all over with a fork, then bake until just
dry to the touch, about 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer base in
pan to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Remove
side of pan and carefully slide out parchment from under
shortbread, then reattach side of pan around shortbread
base. Make mousse while shortbread cools: Sprinkle gelatin
over water in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan and let
stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Heat gelatin mixture
over low heat, stirring, just until gelatin is melted, about
2 minutes. Whisk in chocolate hazelnut spread until combined
and remove from heat. Whisk together mascarpone and
chocolate hazelnut mixture in a large bowl. Beat together
cream, cocoa powder, and sugar in another large bowl with an
electric mixer at low speed until just combined, then
increase speed to high and beat until cream just holds soft
peaks. Whisk one third of whipped cream into mascarpone
mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whipped cream
until well combined. Spoon filling onto shortbread base in
pan, gently smoothing top, then chill, covered, at least 3
hours. Make ganache and glaze cake: Bring cream to a simmer
in a small heavy saucepan and remove from heat. Add
chocolate and let stand 1 minute, then gently whisk until
completely melted and smooth. Transfer ganache to a small
bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until slightly
thickened but still pourable, about 20 minutes. Run a warm
thin knife around inside of springform pan, then remove
side. Slide cake off bottom of pan and transfer to a serving
plate. Pour ganache onto top of cake and spread, allowing
excess ganache to drip down sides.

Espresso Bundt Cake


Ingredients
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 1/2 tablespoons espresso powder
1 3/4 cups cake flour
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 3/4 cups dark brown sugar
3 large eggs, at room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup sour cream, at room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons espresso powder
2 tablespoons milk
2 ounces cream cheese
1 cup powdered sugar
1 pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease
and flour a 10-cup Bundt pan. In a heat-safe bowl or
measuring cup, combine boiling water, cocoa powder, and
espresso powder. Whisk until smooth and combined. Allow
mixture to cool slightly while you prepare the rest of the
cake. Sift together cake flour, salt, baking soda, and
baking powder. Beat butter, oil, and brown sugar in a large
bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3
minutes. Add in eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each
addition. Beat mixture for about 3 minutes on medium-high
speed after adding in last egg. Mix in 1 tablespoon vanilla.
Whisk cocoa powder-espresso mixture again to smooth it out,
then add to butter-sugar mixture. Beat on low speed until
thoroughly combined. Add in half the flour mixture and mix
until just combined. Add in sour cream and mix until just
combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until just
combined. Pour batter evenly into the prepared pan. Tap pan
sharply on the counter a few times to pop any larger air
bubbles. Bake in the preheated oven until top of the cake
springs back lightly when touched, 45 to 50 minutes. Allow
cake to cool in pan for 30 minutes before inverting onto a
serving platter to cool completely. For icing, whisk
espresso powder and milk together in a small bowl until
espresso powder is dissolved. Beat in cream cheese, powdered
sugar, salt, and vanilla with an electric mixer on low speed
to combine, then turn mixer speed up to high; continue to
beat until mixture is smooth and no clumps of cream cheese
remain. If mixture is too thick, add milk, a little at a
time, until icing is the desired consistency. If mixture is
too thin, add more powdered sugar as needed. Drizzle icing
over cooled cake.

Hamburger Bun Bread Pudding


Ingredients
3 tablespoons butter
8 brioche-style hamburger buns
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
5 large eggs
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons whiskey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups milk
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon ketchup
1 teaspoon mustard
1 teaspoon mayonnaise
1/3 cup golden raisins (optional)
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup whiskey
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 pinch salt

Cooking Instructions

Butter a 9x12-inch or 9x13-inch baking dish with 3
tablespoons butter and set aside. If buns are not already
stale and relatively dry, split them open and spread out on

very lightly toasted, about 20 minutes. Let cool. For
custard batter, combine eggs, white sugar, whiskey, vanilla,
cinnamon, salt, milk, cream, ketchup, mustard, and
mayonnaise in a bowl; whisk to combine. Lay 6 bun bottoms
into the prepared baking dish. Break last 2 bun bottoms and
1/2 of a top bun into large pieces and use pieces to fill in
the gaps. Ladle half of custard mixture over buns. Place 6
bun tops over bottom layer and use the last 1 1/2 top buns
to fill in the center gap. Ladle remaining custard mixture
over. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or
preferably up to 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Brush the tops of buns with some of the
custard mixture and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake in the
preheated oven until buns are browned and puffed up, about 1
hour. Remove to cool on a wire rack. For whiskey sauce, add
butter, whiskey, brown sugar, water, and a pinch of salt to
a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Turn off heat and let cool before using. Sauce will thicken
as it cools.

Lemon Coconut Cake


Ingredients
6 large egg yolks,
2/3 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons lemon zest
3/4 cup lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes
3 cups cake flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup sour cream,
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup coconut milk
6 large egg whites,
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
4 cups confectioner's sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon coconut milk
1 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes

Cooking Instructions

For lemon curd, add egg yolks, sugar, lemon zest, lemon
juice, salt, and butter to a small non-reactive saucepan
over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until
mixture begins to simmer and has thickened, 8 to 12 minutes.
Pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl,
using a spatula or wooden spoon to push the mixture through.
Cover with a piece of plastic wrap directly touching the top
of the curd, and refrigerate until chilled. For cakes,
preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease 3 8-inch round cake pans, and line the bottoms with
parchment paper. Place coconut flakes into a food processor
or blender, and pulse a few times until coconut flakes are
finely chopped. Set aside. Sift cake flour, baking powder,
salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. In a separate
large bowl, beat butter, vegetable oil, and sugar together
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 4
minutes. Add in sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and mix
until thoroughly combined. Add in 1/2 of flour mixture and
mix until just combined. Add in coconut milk and mix until
just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until
just combined. In a separate clean bowl, combine egg whites
and cream of tartar. With clean beaters, beat egg whites on
medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.
Add 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the batter, and fold
just until no streaks of whites remain. Add in remaining egg
white mixture and gently fold until no streaks of white
remain. Divide batter evenly between the 3 prepared cake
pans. Bake in the preheated oven until tops of cakes spring
back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cakes to
cool in pans for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack
to cool completely. For frosting, cut cold butter into
1/2-inch pieces. Place into a bowl. Starting on low speed,
beat butter with an electric mixer until just loosened.
Gradually increase the mixer speed, and beat butter until
smooth, about 2 minutes. Add in cold cream cheese, and beat
on medium-high speed until completely smooth and combined,
about 3 minutes. Add in confectioner’s sugar; beat until
thoroughly combined. Add in lemon zest, vanilla, and salt
and mix until combined. Add in remaining confectioner’s
sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add in 1 tablespoon cold coconut milk and beat mixture on
medium-high speed for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. If
frosting is a bit too soft to spread onto the cake layers,
place it into the fridge for about 10 minutes, or until it
is easier to use. To assemble the cake, place one cake layer
onto a cake plate or serving platter. Spread a thin layer of
cream cheese frosting over the top of the cake. Pipe a ring
of frosting around the top edge of the cake. Place about 2
tablespoons of lemon curd in the center of the frosting
ring, and smooth into an even layer. Stack another cake
layer on top of the first, and repeat the process of
frosting and filling. When the last cake layer is stacked on
top, frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer
of frosting. Use your hands to press the toasted coconut
flakes onto the sides of the cake. If desired, drizzle or
swirl the top of cake with some of the extra lemon curd.
Place cake into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes
before serving.

Perfect Cheesecake with Strawberry Topping


Ingredients
14 graham crackers
1/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, melted
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs
2 quarts fresh strawberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup water

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Break
graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor. Add sugar
and pulse until large crumbs form. Add butter and pulse just
until combined and mixture resembles slightly wet sand.
Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan; press mixture
lightly into the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of the
pan. Bake in the preheated oven until fragrant and slightly
golden brown around the edges, about 8 minutes. Let cool.
Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil. Place cream cheese
in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using a paddle attachment,
whip cheese on medium speed just until smooth, to avoid
incorporating too much air. Add sugar and beat until smooth,
scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add in sour
cream, vanilla, lemon juice and salt and blend until just
combined. With the mixer on low speed, add eggs, one at a
time, mixing until each egg is fully incorporated, then mix
until just combined and smooth, scraping down the sides of
the bowl as needed. Pour mixture into the prepared crust.
Wrap bottom and sides of pan well with heavy duty aluminum
foil. Place the pan inside a large deep roasting pan and set
pan in the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the
roasting pan around the cheesecake without letting any water
inside the foil wrap or the cheesecake. Bake in the
preheated oven until the center is very slightly jiggly,
about 50 minutes. Carefully remove pans from the oven and
allow cheesecake to cool in the water bath for 15 to 20
minutes. After about 10 minutes, just when cheesecake starts
to release itself from the sides, run a knife around the
sides. Remove wrapped cheesecake from water bath and place
on a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Unwrap

Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
½ teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
½ cup cold water

Cooking Instructions

Place flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted
with a paddle attachment. Add butter and toss with your

S'mores Cupcakes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
6 tablespoons brown sugar
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch cinnamon
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon espresso powder
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup brown sugar
1 large egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup sour cream
18 large marshmallows
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
2/3 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon almond extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2
cupcake pans with liners. Prepare the crust: Mix graham
cracker crumbs, melted butter, brown sugar, salt, nutmeg,
and cinnamon together in a small bowl until combined. Place
1 packed tablespoon of crumb mixture into the bottom of
about 18 cupcake liners and press into an even layer. Bake
in the preheated oven until graham cracker crusts are
slightly darker in color, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow crusts to
cool. Prepare cupcakes: Whisk boiling water, cocoa powder,
and espresso powder together In a small bowl or measuring
cup until smooth and combined. Set aside to cool slightly.
Beat butter, vegetable oil, and brown sugar in a large bowl
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3
minutes. Add in egg, vanilla, and salt. Beat for an
additional 3 minutes on medium-high speed. Add in cocoa
powder mixture and beat until thoroughly incorporated. Add
in cake flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and mix until
just combined. Add in sour cream; mix until just combined.
Spoon about 2 heaped tablespoons of cake batter over each
graham cracker crust, making sure to fill each liner no more
than 2/3 full. (There may be extra batter to make 1 or 2
extra cupcakes without a graham cracker crust. Simply put
that batter into an empty liner, filling no more than 2/3
full, and bake as a plain chocolate cupcake). Bake in the
preheated oven, 1 pan at a time, until tops of the cupcakes
spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow
cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before carefully
removing to a wire rack to cool completely. To prepare
frosting, place an oven rack directly below the oven's
broiler; preheat broiler. Line a baking sheet with parchment
paper and lightly grease it. Place large marshmallows about
1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Place pan under broiler
and cook until marshmallows are golden brown and puffy,
rotating the pan often to ensure the tops of the
marshmallows brown evenly without burning, about 1 minute.
Remove pan from oven and allow marshmallows to cool. Place
egg whites, white sugar, cold water, cream of tartar, and
pinch of salt in a very large heatproof mixing bowl. Place
the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water (do not allow
the bottom of the bowl to touch the water), and begin to
beat the mixture on low speed with an electric hand mixer.
Gradually increase speed to medium-high and continue to whip
mixture over hot water until mixture holds stiff peaks, 8 to
10 minutes. Remove from heat and beat for 1 minute more. Add
in toasted marshmallows, vanilla, and almond extract.
Beginning on low speed and gradually increasing the speed to
high, beat mixture until completely smooth and no lumps of
toasted marshmallow remain, and the mixture once again holds
stiff peaks, 5 to 7 minutes. Place mixture into a large
piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Generously pipe
marshmallow frosting onto the top of each cooled cupcake. If
desired, use a kitchen torch to caramelize the frosting
until golden brown.

bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking up crackers as
needed to fill space. Spread 3 cups of the pudding mixture
in an even layer over crackers. Top pudding mixture with 2
cups of the sliced bananas. Drizzle evenly with about 2
tablespoons of the salted caramel mixture. Repeat layering
process once more, ending with a layer of salted caramel.
Evenly top with remaining 34 crackers, breaking them as
needed to fit. Spread remaining 3 cups pudding mixture over
crackers. Store, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 8
hours or up to overnight. Before serving, top with remaining
2 cups sliced bananas. Drizzle with salted caramel sauce and
sprinkle flaky sea salt. Cut into slices and serve drizzled
with extra caramel sauce if desired.

2 cups strawberries
6 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 2/3 cups cake flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar
3 large egg whites
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2/3 cup sour cream
1/3 cup 2% milk
2 ounces cream cheese, chilled
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream

Cooking Instructions

Strawberries: Place strawberries and sugar in a small pot
over medium-low heat. Bring mixture to a simmer, stirring
often, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir cornstarch and water
together in a small bowl or measuring cup. Stir cornstarch
mixture into the strawberry mixture, and cook until
thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat, and stir in
lemon zest and lemon juice. Pour mixture into a heat safe
bowl, and place uncovered into the fridge to chill. (Once

vanilla, and almond extract, and beat mixture on medium-high
speed for another 3 minutes. Add in half of flour mixture
and mix until just combined. Add in sour cream and milk; mix
until just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture; mix
until just combined. Pour batter into prepared cupcake pans,
filling each liner no more than 2/3 full. Bake one pan at a
time, until tops of cupcakes spring back when lightly
touched, 22 to 26 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan
for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool
completely, about 30 minutes Chill cupcakes in the
refrigerator for about 1 hour. This will make them easier to
cut and fill. Cream cheese whipped cream: Beat chilled cream
cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt together until
smooth. Add in 1/2 cup cold heavy cream, and mix on low
until mixture is smooth. Add in remaining heavy cream; beat

place mixture into a piping bag fitted with an open star tip
(such as a Wilton® 1M). Place piping bag in refrigerator
until ready to use. Remove cupcakes from refrigerator.
Remove the liners and cut tops off cupcakes. Pipe a layer of
whipped cream on bottom half of cupcakes; top with about 1
to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. Place tops of cupcakes
back on, and lightly press down to adhere. Pipe more whipped
cream on top of cupcakes and top with another 1 to 2
teaspoons strawberry mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for
30 minutes before serving.

Strawberry Oreo Cheesecake


Ingredients
2 cups fresh strawberries
6 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 1/4 cups Oreo® cookies
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
16 small strawberries
4 Oreo® cookies
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
1 pinch ground nutmeg
3 large eggs

Cooking Instructions

Strawberry sauce: Place strawberries, sugar, lemon juice,
and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook,
stirring often, until strawberries soften and release their
juices, about 10 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash
strawberries. Stir water and cornstarch together in a small
bowl. Add cornstarch mixture to strawberries, and cook,
stirring constantly, until mixture begins to thicken, 1 to 2
minutes more. Remove from heat, and carefully pour mixture
through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl; use the back of a
wooden spoon or spatula to press out as much juice as
possible. Discard pulp. Place strawberry sauce, uncovered,
into the refrigerator to cool. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom of a
9-inch springform pan. Oreo crust: Combine cookie crumbs,
brown sugar, and salt. Stir in melted butter until
thoroughly combined. Press mixture evenly into the bottom
and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Place pan on a
rimmed baking sheet. Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15
minutes. Remove from the oven, leaving oven on, and allow to
cool for 10 minutes. Cheesecake filling: Beat cream cheese
and sugar until thoroughly smooth and combined. Add in heavy
cream, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, almond extract,
and nutmeg; beat on low speed until smooth. Add in eggs, and
beat on low speed just until eggs are incorporated. Pour
half of filling into crust. Drizzle 6 tablespoons of cooled
strawberry sauce over filling. Pour remaining filling into
the pan, taking care to cover strawberry sauce. Reserve
remaining strawberry sauce, covered, in the refrigerator
until ready to serve the cheesecake. Return cheesecake to
the oven and bake until the top looks set, and edges are
beginning to turn golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Turn oven
off, prop the door slightly ajar, and leave cheesecake to
cool in the oven for 1 hour. Remove cheesecake to a wire
rack. Run a knife around the top edge of cheesecake to
loosen it slightly from the pan; allow to cool in the pan to
room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8
hours. When ready to serve, toss halved strawberries into
reserved strawberry sauce until thoroughly coated. Remove
cheesecake from springform pan; place on a serving platter.
Pour strawberries and sauce on top of the cake, and turn all
the berries cut-side-down. Garnish with halved Oreos, if
desired. Keep extra cheesecake stored in the fridge.

1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup water

Flip and cook until browned on other side, 1 to 2 minutes
more. Remove from pan and immediately drape over parchment-
lined book, pressing to help form that taco shell shape.
Transfer to a parchment-lined plate and repeat with
remaining batter. Let cool completely before filling.
Alternatively, preheat a waffle cone maker according to
manufacturer's instructions. Pour batter into the preheated
waffle maker and cook according to instructions. Remove from
pan and immediately drape across the parchment-lined book.
Let cool completely before filling. Remove ice cream from
the freezer and let soften for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile,
combine chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe
bowl; microwave in 30-second intervals, mixing well between
each, until mixture is melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in chopped peanuts. Carefully fill the taco shells with
the ice cream, pressing down gently to evenly distribute the
ice cream to the edges. Repeat with the remaining taco
shells. Place back on the parchment-lined plate. Dip the top
of each ice cream taco in the peanut-chocolate mixture to
completely coat the exposed ice cream. Return to the
parchment-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining tacos until
all are dipped. Once chocolate has hardened, carefully place
Choco Tacos in a sealable container or bag and return to
freezer.

Wildflower Honey Cake


Ingredients
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup unsalted butter
2/3 cup honey
3 tablespoons plain yogurt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 large eggs
1/3 cup sliced almonds
1/3 cup honey
3 tablespoons water

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a
9-inch round cake pan, and line the base with a circle of
parchment. Whisk flour, baking powder, and kosher salt
together in a bowl; set aside. Beat butter and honey
together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and
fluffy. Add yogurt, vanilla, 2 eggs, and about 1/3 of flour
mixture. Mix until everything is incorporated. Add the
remaining 2 eggs and flour; mix just until flour disappears.
Use a spatula to spread batter into the prepared pan. Smooth
top and apply almonds to the surface. Bake in the preheated
oven until a toothpick comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
Cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make syrup: Toast
honey in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it turns a
light brown, and takes on a caramelized honey aroma. Turn
off heat and add water. Swirl the pan to stir in the water,
and let cool until needed. Invert cake onto a plate, and
soak the top evenly with toasted honey syrup. Cool cake
completely before serving.

banana pudding


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Separate eggs, placing the whites in the bowl of a stand
mixer and the yolks into a saucepan. Prepare the custard:
Add sugar, salt, and 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour to the
yolks. Splash in about 1/4 of the milk and start blending
mixture with a whisk. Pour in remaining milk and whisk until
smooth. Cook and stir mixture over medium heat until hot to
the touch, occasionally dipping your finger in to test.
Whisk constantly until custard is thick enough to form
ribbons. Remove custard from heat and add banana liqueur,
vanilla, then cold butter. Whisk until butter dissolves. Set
custard aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200
degrees C). Begin to assemble the pudding: Toss banana
slices with lemon juice. Spread 1/4 of the custard over the
bottom of a baking dish. Add a single layer of vanilla
wafers. Cover with 1/2 of the bananas and spread 1/2 of the
remaining custard on top. Add another layer of vanilla
wafers, using slightly fewer this time. Top with remaining
bananas and custard. Smooth the top and tap dish against the
counter to settle the pudding. Make the meringue topping:
Add cream of tartar to the egg whites. Beat using the whisk
attachment until foamy. Gradually add sugar and beat until
stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Spread meringue over the
pudding using a soft spatula, creating ridges for contrast.
Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is nicely browned,
7 to 10 minutes. Serve warm or chilled.

cinnamon rolls


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then
remove from heat. Mix in the butter; stir until melted. Add
water and let cool until lukewarm. In a large bowl, combine
the milk mixture, yeast, white sugar, salt, eggs and 2 cups
flour; stir well to combine. Stir in the remaining flour,
1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When
the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8
minutes. Divide dough into two pieces. Roll each piece into
a 12x9 inch rectangle. In a bowl, stir together the cinnamon
and brown sugar. Spread each piece with half of the butter,
half of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. Roll up dough,
using a little water to seal the seam. Cut each roll into 12
slices using a very sharp knife or dental floss. Place rolls
onto two 9x13 inch greased baking pans. Cover and let rise
until almost doubled, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat oven
to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for
20 to 25 minutes until golden brown. To make frosting;
combine confectioner's sugar, cream cheese, butter and
vanilla. Add milk gradually until frosting reaches a
spreading consistency. Spread over warm (but not hot)
cinnamon rolls.
