Air Fryer Pork Tenderloin with Sweet Potatoes


Ingredients
¼ cup olive oil, plus more for greasing
½ cup pineapple preserves
½ teaspoon granulated garlic
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
½ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper, or to taste
1 ½ pounds sweet potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 ½ pounds pork tenderloins

Cooking Instructions

Preheat air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C), if
recommended by manufacturer. Combine olive oil, pineapple
preserves, garlic granules, cayenne, salt, and white pepper
in a large mixing bowl; stir to combine. Place sweet potato
pieces into the mixing bowl and toss with the pineapple
preserves mixture. Remove sweet potatoes to a plate,
reserving the remaining pineapple mixture. Pat tenderloins
dry with paper towels. Place in the mixing bowl with the
remaining pineapple mixture and toss to coat. Brush interior
basket of the air fryer with the remaining olive oil. Place
tenderloins in the basket, and in a single layer, add as
many sweet potato pieces as will fit around the tenderloins.
Set aside extra sweet potato pieces. You will cook them as a
second batch. Air fry for 10 minutes. Turn tenderloins over,
browned side down. Stir sweet potatoes, but keep them in a
single layer. Air fry until pork loin is slightly pink in
the center, about 10 minutes longer. An instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
145 degrees F (63 degrees C). If the tenderloins need more
cooking time, turn them again and continue cooking and
testing the temperature in 5 minute increments. Remove sweet
potatoes from the air fryer when they are tender and
caramelized. (See Cook's Note). When the tenderloins test
done, place them on a platter and tent with foil. Allow to
rest while the remaining sweet potatoes cook, about 10 more
minutes.

2 teaspoons miso paste
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Bihari Kabab


Ingredients
1 1/4 pounds tenderloin,
1/4 cup avocado oil
1/2 onion, thinly sliced
1 kiwi, peeled and quartered
1 1/2 tablespoons gram flour
1/2 tablespoon poppy seeds
1 tablespoon garlic paste
1 tablespoon ginger paste
1 small serrano chile pepper
1/4 cup mustard oil
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1/4 cup plain full fat yogurt
1/2 nutmeg seed
1 tablespoon mace
5 star anise pods
5 whole dried red Kashmiri chilies
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt

Cooking Instructions

Pound tenderloin strips with a meat mallet until they are
very thin; set aside. Heat avocado oil in a frying pan over
medium heat. Fry onion in the hot oil until it is a deep
brown, about 5 minutes. Strain browned onion into a small
bowl using a slotted spoon, and set aside to use later. Peel
kiwi, cut into quarters, and set aside in a small bowl for
later. Heat a small non-stick skillet over medium heat, and
toast gram flour until lightly browned and nutty, 2 to 4
minutes; transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Dry-roast
poppy seeds in the same skillet until lightly brown and
aromatic, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove to a small bowl; set aside.
In the same skillet, dry-roast nutmeg, mace, star anise, and
Kashmiri chilies together until fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes.
Transfer the whole spices and chilies to a spice grinder,
and grind them to a coarse powder. Add browned onions, kiwi,
ginger paste, garlic paste, and serrano chile to the bowl of
a food processor, and grind to a paste, about 30 seconds.
Pour in mustard oil, white vinegar, and yogurt and pulse the
food processor until everything is well blended, about 15
seconds. Last of all, add roasted poppy seeds, roasted gram
flour, roasted ground whole spices, chili powder, cumin,
garam masala, black pepper, and salt to the food processor;
process marinade for 1 minute. Spoon marinade into a
resealable plastic bag and add tenderized beef strips. Seal
bag and squeeze gently to coat beef on all sides with
marinade. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, but ideally
overnight. Remove marinated beef from the refrigerator;
thread beef strips on sturdy metal skewers, packing them in
tightly. Reserve any leftover marinade to baste the kababs
with as they cook. This prevents them from drying out.
Preheat an outdoor grill to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C)
and lightly oil the grate. Grill kababs on the preheated
grill, uncovered, for 5 minutes per side. Reduce grill
temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), cover the
grill, and cook kababs for 10 minutes. Turn kebabs, brush
with marinade, and continue cooking until the internal
temperature of the meat reaches 170 degrees F (77 degrees
C), about 10 minutes more. If kababs look a bit dry at any
point in the cooking process, brush both sides with a little
bit of avocado oil. Remove skewers to a serving dish.
Discard any uncooked marinade. Enjoy the kababs with naan,
sliced red onions, tamarind chutney, and green chutney.

Chef John's Chicken Lazone


Ingredients
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 lemon, juiced
2/3 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup green onions
1 tablespoon butter, cubed

Cooking Instructions

Mix chili powder, smoked paprika, cayenne, black pepper,
garlic powder, and onion powder together in a small bowl;
set aside. Half will be used for the chicken rub and half
for the sauce. Season chicken on both sides with salt.
Sprinkle half the spice mixture over both sides of chicken.
Wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour (or up to overnight), or
until ready to cook. Heat oil in a heavy-duty nonstick pan
over medium-high heat. Sear chicken, turning once, about 3
to 4 minutes per side; chicken will be about 75% cooked at
this point, and will finish cooking in the sauce. Turn off
heat; transfer chicken to a plate and set aside. Add
remaining spice mixture to the pan and stir around in the
hot oil for 30 seconds. Add lemon juice, cream, and water.
Stir in a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high
heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce to medium-low and return
chicken to the pan along with any accumulated juices. Simmer
gently, turning occasionally to coat with sauce, until
chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run
clear, 8 to 10 minutes. Time will vary based on size of
chicken breasts. An instant-read thermometer inserted near
the center will read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Reduce
heat to low and add green onions and butter. Stir into the
sauce, while also basting chicken with the sauce. Taste for
seasoning and serve.

1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
2 large eggs
1/4 cup beer or water

Creamy Chicken Fajita Pasta


Ingredients
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon cumin
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Mexican oregano
1 ½ pounds chicken breasts, cut into strips
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 red onion, peeled and cut into ½-inch wedges
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 cup chicken broth, or more as needed
1 cup salsa
4 cups milk
1 pound penne pasta
1 red bell pepper, cut into ½-inch strips
1 green bell pepper, cut into ½-inch strips
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into ½-inch strips
4 cups shredded Mexican 4-cheese blend
¼ cup minced cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Combine chili powder, cumin, salt, onion powder, garlic
powder, and Mexican oregano in a small bowl for the
seasoning blend. Season chicken with half of the seasoning;
reserve remaining seasoning for later. Heat 1 tablespoon
olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken
strips and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Transfer chicken to a plate. Heat remaining oil in the same
pot. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened,

scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan
with a wooden spoon. Add milk and dry pasta to the pot and
stir to combine. Add chicken and bell peppers on top and
bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a light simmer and cook,
gently stirring every 4 to 5 minutes, until pasta is cooked
through and sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes. Try and
keep noodles as submerged as possible while cooking. If the
consistency becomes too thick, add a bit more chicken broth.
Season with remaining seasoning blend, to taste. Stir in
Mexican cheese and combine until melted. Sprinkle with
cilantro to serve.

Creamy Garlic Parmesan Chicken


Ingredients
2 pounds chicken breast tenders
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
½ cup all-purpose flour
2 large eggs, beaten
1 ½ cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
parchment paper
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, or more as needed
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
3 cloves garlic, minced
½ cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
2 cups heavy cream
chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Pat chicken tenders dry with paper towels and season lightly
with salt and pepper. Place flour on a shallow plate. Place
beaten eggs into a shallow bowl. Combine grated Parmesan
cheese, Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, and 1 teaspoon smoked
paprika, and place on a second shallow plate. Cover a dinner
plate or platter with parchment paper. Dip each lightly
seasoned chicken breast tender in flour, shaking off the
excess. Next, dip in beaten egg, and hold the tender over
the eggs to allow excess to drip back into the bowl. Place
each tender on the panko mixture. With dry fingers, scoop
panko mix over the tender, patting the crumbs in. Place on
the parchment-covered plate. Repeat with remaining chicken
tenders, until all tenders are breaded with flour, egg, and
panko mix. Melt 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive
oil in a large skillet over medium heat until butter is
bubbling. Add tenders, 1 at a time, being careful not to
crowd the skillet. You may need to cook chicken in 2
batches. Cook until breading is browned and chicken is no
longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 4
minutes per side, being careful not to burn the breading.
Turn tenders when the crust is nicely browned and continue
cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Adjust heat down a notch or two, if the crust is getting too
brown, and add a bit more oil or butter, if the skillet
looks dry. Remove cooked chicken to a cooling rack. Add
garlic to the skillet, and stir until garlic is fragrant, 30
to 45 seconds. Deglaze skillet with white wine, stirring up
all the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Season
Italian herb seasoning blend and red pepper flakes. Stir in
cream and heat over medium high. Bring sauce to a boil,
stirring frequently, and adjust flavor with salt and pepper,
if needed. Allow sauce to bubble until desired consistency
is achieved, 3 to 4 minutes. Return cooked chicken tenders
to the skillet and warm in the sauce, about 1 minute.
Garnish with fresh parsley.

Greek-Style Chicken Pops


Ingredients
2/3 cup plain Greek yogurt
1/2 cup olive oil
1 lemon, zested and juiced
2 tablespoons Greek seasoning
1 tablespoon garlic
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
8 chicken legs
parsley

Cooking Instructions

Combine Greek yogurt, olive oil, lemon zest and juice, Greek
seasoning, and garlic in a large resealable bag. Season with
salt and pepper (see Note). Gently squeeze the ingredients
inside the bag to mix. For each chicken leg, hold the bony
tip with one hand and run a knife around the bone, just
below the meaty part, cutting all the way to the bone. Use
kitchen shears to sever the tendon, if necessary, and remove
any exposed tendon. With the knife, push the meat down
toward the meaty joint, being careful to avoid the slender
secondary bone. Cut away as much as possible of the
secondary bone. Again, push the meat down toward the meaty
joint, forming a little ball. Remove skin and cartilage from
the bony tip and remove any tissue with a knife or with
kitchen shears. Place chicken pops inside the bag with the
marinade. Seal the bag, with as little air inside the bag as
possible. Gently squeeze chicken pops and marinade until
pops are well coated. Marinate in the refrigerator for at
least 3 hours, or up to 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 400
degrees F (200 degrees C), and line a baking pan with foil.
Remove chicken pops from marinade. Reform the meaty ball,
and wrap bony ends with a small piece of foil (see Note).
Place on the prepared pan in a single layer. Bake in the
preheated oven for 25 minutes. Turn on the broiler, and set
a rack 6 inches from the heat source. Broil until brown, 3
to 5 minutes per side. An instant read thermometer, inserted
near the center, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Cool in the pan 2 to 3 minutes, then place on a serving
plate. Garnish with parsley sprigs, cherry tomatoes, and
Kalamata olives, if desired.

Grilled Tomahawk Steak


Ingredients
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon ontreal steak seasoning
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak
1/4 cup salted butter, at room temperature
1 tablespoon shallot
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chives
2 teaspoons steak rub

Cooking Instructions

To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak
seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small
airtight container; shake or stir to combine. Set aside 2
teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter. Place steak
on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and sides
with remaining steak rub until well coated. Place steak,
uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine overnight. For
compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and
the reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl. Mash
together with a fork until evenly combined. Spoon butter
into a small airtight container, cover, and refrigerate
until ready to use. Remove steak from the refrigerator 1
hour before cooking to take the chill off. It will cook on
the sheet pan that you used for dry-brining. Preheat the
oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). The reverse sear
method is used to cook this big steak, so you will need an
instant-read thermometer. If you are using a digital meat
thermometer, set the internal temperature to 110 degrees F
(43 degrees C). Bake steak on the sheet pan in the preheated
oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center reads 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), about 45 minutes.
Begin checking the temperature at 30 minutes. During the
last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time, preheat an outdoor
grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. When steak
reaches an internal temperature of 110 degrees F (43 degrees
C) measured with an instant-read thermometer, remove it from
the oven. Grill steak directly on the grates of the
preheated grill; sear on both sides, about 2 minutes per
side. This is a fatty piece of meat, so be mindful of flame
flare-ups. The internal temperature should now read 125 to
135 degrees F (51 to 57 degrees C) for medium rare. Remove
steak from the grill, and smear compound butter over top.
Let butter melt into the steak, heating up the fresh garlic,
shallots, and chives. Let steak rest for 10 minutes. Slice
steak and serve with accumulated juices and melted butter.
Be sure to serve the bone–someone will want to gnaw on it!

Hamburgers with Grilled Apple and Chili Crisp


Ingredients
2 red apples
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons chili crisp
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 (1/3-inch) slices red onion
4 hamburger buns
1/4 cup mayonnaise

Cooking Instructions

Slice 1 apple using a mandoline slicer to create 8
(1/4-inch-thick) slices. Shred any remaining scraps plus all
or part of the second apple to get 1/2 cup shredded apple.
Squeeze shredded apple to extract some of the moisture.
Reserve any remaining apple for another use. Preheat an
outdoor grill to medium heat (350 to 375 degrees F (175 to
190 degrees C)). Combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, 1
tablespoon chili crisp, salt, and the 1/2 cup shredded apple
in a bowl. Shape into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) patties, 4 inches
in diameter. Mixture may be wet so be sure to tightly pack
patties. Oil the grill grate. Grill patties, covered,
carefully turning halfway through, until an instant-read
thermometer inserted into centers of patties reads 160
degrees F (71 degrees C), 10 to 13 minutes. Grill onion
slices, turning halfway through, 8 to 10 minutes. Grill
apple slices, turning halfway through, 4 to 5 minutes. If
you like, grill buns, cut sides down, until toasted, 1 to 2
minutes. When onions are cool enough to handle, separate
rings. Stir mayonnaise and remaining 2 teaspoons chili crisp
together in a small bowl. Spread buns with mayonnaise
mixture and fill with patties, onion, and apple slices.
Serve with additional chili crisp

Hawaiian-Style Kalua Pork


Ingredients
1 4 1/2 pound) pork shoulder roast
4 teaspoons liquid hickory smoke
3 tablespoons sea salt
1 (!4 ounce) package banana leaves, thawed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place
pork in a large bowl and rub all over with liquid smoke.
Sprinkle salt over meat, and rub in until evenly coated. Set
aside. Place banana leaves on the counter, arranging them in
a spiral, overlapping pattern, so once pork is placed on the
leaves, they can be folded up and over to fully encase the
meat. Place pork on the center of leaves, fat side down, and
wrap the meat with the seams coming together at the top.
Once wrapped, pick up and invert the entire package, seam
side down, into a Dutch oven. Any extra banana leaves can be
tucked in around the sides. Bake, covered, in the preheated
oven for about 4 hours, or an instant-read thermometer
inserted near the center reads 195 to 200 degrees F (91 to
93 degrees C). Let pork rest in the Dutch oven for 30 to 60
minutes, then remove the meat to a bowl. Pull meat off the
bone, and set bone aside. Add any and all cooking liquids
and rendered fat into the bowl of pork. Use two forks to
shred meat as finely as you like. Taste for seasoning;
adjust with more salt or liquid smoke to taste. Arrange
banana leaves in the pot to make a nest for the meat.
Transfer shredded pork in and serve immediately.

1/3 cup heavy cream
basil
lemon slices for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Combine lemon zest and juice, minced garlic, red pepper
flakes, and chicken broth in a small bowl and set aside.
Slice each chicken breast in half horizontally to create 4
cutlets. Pat dry with paper towels and lightly season with
salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over
medium heat. When the oil shimmers, carefully add chicken
pieces and brown for 3 to 5 minutes per side. Chicken will

same skillet, add shallots and cook until softened, about 2
minutes. Add chicken broth mixture and bring to a boil.
Return chicken to the skillet with any accumulated juices.
Add asparagus pieces around chicken and sprinkle on minced
basil. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to simmer
until asparagus is tender, and chicken is no longer pink at
the center and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove
cover and increase heat to medium. Melt butter, one
tablespoon at a time, stirring continuously, allowing sauce
to thicken a little. Remove from heat and stir in cream. To
serve, place in a serving dish and garnish with additional

Sous Vide Beef Tenderloin Roast


Ingredients
4 ½ pounds whole beef tenderloin
1 tablespoon sea salt/kosher salt (such as Redmonds®)
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
6 cloves garlic
3 fresh thyme sprigs, or to taste
rosemary sprig
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, or more as needed
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
1 splash red wine
1 tablespoon gelatin powder
1 cup cold water
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Trim and tie tenderloin together with kitchen twine the
night before cooking. Combine salt and pepper in a bowl and
season tenderloin on all sides. Place on a baking rack set
over a cookie sheet and allow to rest, uncovered, in the
refrigerator overnight. The next morning place tenderloin,
garlic, thyme, and rosemary into a sous vide vacuum bag and
seal using a vacuum sealer. Refrigerate until you are ready
to sous vide. Attach sous vide cooker to a heat-proof
container of water and set temperature to 133 degrees F (56
degrees C). Sous vide until tenderloin has reached the
desired temperature, 2 1/2 to 3 hours, depending on
thickness. About 30 minutes pour water in a metal bowl and
sprinkle gelatin powder on top. Allow to sit for 30 minutes
until gelatin blooms. Set on top of a double boiler over
simmering water and stir until a clear liquid forms. Do not
allow to boil. Remove tenderloin from sous vide, pat dry,
and let rest while preparing the gravy. Pour au jus liquids
from the sous vide bag into a sauce pan. Stir in 1 to 2
tablespoons butter and red wine. Add as much of the bloomed
gelatin as you like depending on desired thickness and whisk
until well combined. Season gravy with salt, pepper, and
herbs to taste. Heat cast iron pan to medium-high. Brush
tenderloin with olive oil and sear in the hot pan until
browned all over, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Melt extra butter
in the pan as desired. Remove from pan, tent with foil, and
allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Slice tenderloin and
serve with gravy.

Air Fryer Smashed Potatoes


Ingredients
8 ounces baby gold potatoes
1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Meanwhile, place potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl: cook on
high until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer potatoes
to a baking sheet and use the bottom of a small glass to

you flatten the potatoes, the crispier they will be. Brush
melted butter over the tops of smashed potatoes. Season with
salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Place potatoes in the
basket of the air fryer in an even layer; cook until golden
and crisp, about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve

Big Fat Fondant Potatoes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon miso paste
1 1/2 teaspoons dashi powder
6 large russet potatoes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2/3 cup chicken broth

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring
chicken broth to a simmer; whisk in miso and dashi. Turn off
the heat; set aside until needed. Turn potatoes onto
narrowest side; trim straight down to create a flat surface.
Turn and trim the other side with a straight cut parallel to
the first. Cut a little off each end to square the potato a
bit more, then make 2 angled cuts on each side of the
squared ends. Transfer to a bowl of cold water. Reserve
trimmings for another use. Drain, and dry with paper towels.
Place a large cast-iron pan or other heavy ovenproof skillet
on high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil; place potatoes in
skillet with largest flat side down. Season tops with half
the salt. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook until well
browned, about 4 minutes. Turn potatoes over and repeat, to
salt and brown the other side, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat
to medium, and use a paper towel to soak up excess oil
between potatoes in the pan. Add butter, and as it melts,
baste tops of potatoes with melted butter. Once butter has
toasted to a light brown color, turn off the heat and strain
in the miso dashi broth. Roast potatoes, uncovered, in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Remove and turn
potatoes over. Add the 2/3 cup plain chicken broth, and
return to the oven to continue roasting at 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C) until potatoes can be pierced very easily
with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes more. Check occasionally to
see if broth has evaporated; add more as needed. Brush tops
of potatoes with pan drippings, and serve.

Easy Fermented Pickled Veggies


Ingredients
3 cups water
3 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 pound VEGETABLES)
1 bunch HERBS)
2 teaspoons peppercorns
3 cloves garlic,

Cooking Instructions

To sanitize jar, put a 1-quart wide-mouthed canning jar in a
6- to 8-quart pot; cover with tap water. (You could also use
multiple smaller wide-mouthed canning jars.) Bring to a
boil; boil 10 minutes. Using tongs, carefully remove jar
from pot, draining excess water; let jar cool slightly.
Meanwhile, for brine, stir together filtered water and salt
in a 1-quart measuring cup until salt is dissolved. Add
radishes (or other VEGETABLES), mint (or other HERBS),
peppercorns (or other KICK), and garlic to jar. Veggies can
be packed tightly; they will shrink and soften as they
pickle. Fill jar with brine; you may have brine left over.
Add a fermenting weight or an inverted, sanitized plastic
lid to keep vegetables submerged. Cover jar with a kitchen
towel, securing with a rubber band. Let stand at room
temperature for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days. You’ll
start to see bubbles forming. The vegetables will become
more tart and the brine will become cloudier the longer the
pickles stand. Remove fermenting weight and screw on metal
lid. Chill up to 3 weeks.

Roasted Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce


Ingredients
1 pound asparagus,
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 large egg yolks
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon water
1/2 cup butter
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
1 large hard boiled egg, peeled
1 tablespoon chives (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Place asparagus on
the prepared pan and drizzle olive oil over the spears.
Season with salt and pepper. Using clean hands, toss
asparagus spears until evenly coated with olive oil and
seasonings, then spread asparagus in a single layer on the
pan. Roast in the center of the preheated oven until fork-
tender, 10 to 12 minutes; thicker asparagus may require more
time. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, and water
together in a heavy saucepan or small skillet with a wire
whisk until well blended. Season with salt and pepper. Turn
heat to medium-low; and whisk continuously, being careful to
stir the entire bottom and sides of the pan, until eggs
begin to thicken slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. If eggs start to
curdle, remove pan from heat, and continue whisking briskly
and continuously until any lumps disappear. Gradually whisk
in hot melted butter, about a tablespoon at a time, whisking
briskly after each addition. Adjust salt and pepper, if
necessary, and stir in cayenne pepper. When whisking, each
stroke of the whisk should reveal the bottom of the pan. If
the sauce is too thick, whisk in a drop or two of water or
lemon juice. To serve, plate asparagus and pour Hollandaise
sauce on top. Grate hard-boiled egg over Hollandaise, and
garnish with snipped chives.

1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
6 slices bacon
1 onion
4 green onions, divided
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
4 ounces okra, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cloves garlic
2 tomatoes
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, or to taste (optional)
2 cups peanut oil or other vegetable oil for frying
3 large eggs
1 1/2 pounds shrimp,
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 green onions, thinly sliced
chopped parsley for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine water, milk, butter, and salt in a large saucepan
and bring just to a boil. Whisk in grits until incorporated.
Reduce heat to simmer, cover, and cook until thick, 25 to 30
minutes, stirring often. If mixture gets too thick, add a
little more milk or water. Cut kernels off corn cobs, and
using the back of the knife, carefully scrape the cob to
release the creamy corn milk. Stir corn kernels and corn
milk into grits and continue cooking until grits are creamy
and tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer, stirring often. Stir in
pepper and adjust seasonings if necessary. Meanwhile, heat a
large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add olive
oil and bacon slices in a single layer, and cook until bacon
is crisp, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Remove
bacon from the skillet, drain on paper towels, and set
aside. Crumble bacon once cool enough to handle. Reserve
drippings in the skillet and return skillet to medium-high
heat. Finely slice green onions and reserve green ends for
garnish. Add white parts of green onion, onion, green and
red bell peppers, and okra to the skillet and cook until
softened and lightly browned, stirring often, about 5
minutes. Add in salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne and
cook for 1 minute. Add fresh tomatoes and garlic, and cook
for 2 minutes. Add butter to mixture and allow it to melt.
Sprinkle flour over skillet and cook, stirring constantly,
about 1 minute. Add in tomatoes, with juices, and stock
while stirring constantly until smooth. Stir in sugar,
Worcestershire, and hot sauce, and return mixture to a
simmer. Cook gravy for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Heat peanut oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large,
deep skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs in a bowl;
add shrimp and stir to coat. In a shallow dish, whisk flour,
salt, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Working a
few at a time, remove shrimp from egg, allowing excess to
drip off, and lightly coat in flour mixture. Transfer shrimp
to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with
remaining shrimp. Working in batches, add shrimp to hot oil
and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned and
crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on a wire rack set over a paper
towel-lined baking sheet. To serve, place grits in the
bottom of a shallow bowl. Top with about 1/2 cup of gravy
and 6 to 8 shrimp. Top with crumbled bacon, and sprinkle
with green onions and parsley if desired.

asparagus


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over
medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper
towel-lined plate. Crumble bacon when cool; set aside.
Reserve 1 tablespoon of bacon drippings. Melt butter with
drippings in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir
celery and onion in the saucepan until onion is translucent,
about 4 minutes. Whisk flour into the mixture and cook for 1
minute. Whisk in chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add
potato and chopped asparagus stalks, reserving the asparagus
tips for later. Season with salt and ground black pepper.
Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Pour the soup into a
blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold
down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and
carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get
the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in
batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately,
you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the
cooking pot. Cook and stir mushrooms and asparagus tips in
the same skillet used for bacon until mushrooms give up
their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and ground

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place
bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook,
stirring occasionally, until lightly browned but still soft,
about 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Set

remaining 5 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, garlic,
kosher salt, and black pepper in a large bowl until marinade
is well combined. Add Brussels sprouts to marinade in the
bowl; toss until evenly coated. Use a slotted spoon to place
Brussels sprouts over lemon slices in the baking dish,
draining excess marinade back into the bowl. Scatter cooked
bacon over Brussels sprouts. Add potatoes to remaining
marinade in the bowl; toss until evenly coated. Use a
slotted spoon to arrange potatoes along the inside edge of
the baking dish, draining excess marinade back into the
bowl. Add chicken breast halves to remaining marinade in the

vegetables in the baking dish. Pour any remaining marinade
over chicken. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no
longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1
hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone
should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Air Fryer Cinnamon Roll Bites


Ingredients
1 (12.4 ounce) cinnamon rolls
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon orange peel
1 tablespoon orange juice
icing

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Add sugar and
cinnamon to a large resealable plastic bag, and shake to

brand and size of your air fryer, you may have to cook in
batches, and your timing may vary, so watch closely.
Meanwhile, prepare the dip. Add cream cheese, confectioner’s
sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and the packaged icing to
a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed
until you reach a dipping consistency, about 1 minute. Drop
the warm pieces into the sugar-cinnamon mixture, and shake.

Banana Bread Brownies


Ingredients
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 ounces dark chocolate, broken into pieces
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 large egg
2 bananas, mashed (about 1 cup)
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
12 slices banana (optional)
2 tablespoons white sugar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Generously butter a 9x9-inch square pan. A piece of
parchment paper can also be added to the bottom of the pan
to prevent sticking. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Melt chocolate
in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second
intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an
electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg, vanilla, and
mashed banana, and beat until combined. Add chocolate, and
beat until mixture is well combined and smooth. Use a
spatula to mix in walnuts and chocolate chips, then use the
spatula to mix in flour just until flour disappears.
Transfer batter into the prepared pan and smooth top. Place
banana slices on top, evenly spaced in a grid pattern. Bake
in the preheated oven until a skewer comes out almost clean
but with some batter on the very tip. If you want fudgier
brownies, do not overcook. Let brownies cool in the pan.
Cover, refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour, and serve
chilled. For optional banana brûlée: While brownies are
cooling, cover each banana slice with a half teaspoon of
sugar. Use a propane kitchen torch to melt the sugar until
dark brown and bubbling. Be careful not to char the edges of
the crust around the banana too much. This banana brûlée
step can also be done before the brownies go into the oven.

Classic Glazed Doughnuts


Ingredients
⅓ cup milk
⅓ cup cake flour
1 cup milk
4 ¼ cups cake flour, plus more for dusting
1 package active dry yeast
5 ounces evaporated milk
½ cup butter, melted and cooled
2 large eggs
¼ cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups vegetable oil for frying
3 cups powdered sugar
½ cup melted butter
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
⅛ teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons hot water

Cooking Instructions

For tangzhong, whisk together 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup cake
flour in a small saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, over
medium heat until a very thick paste forms, about 3 minutes
(watch constantly—it thickens quickly). Cool briefly. Heat 1
cup milk in a second saucepan to 105 degrees F to 115
degrees F (40 degrees C to 46 degrees C). Transfer warm milk
to the bowl of a stand mixer; stir in yeast and let stand
for 5 minutes. Add evaporated milk, melted butter, eggs,
sugar, salt, vanilla, the cooled tangzhong, and 2 cups cake
flour to the stand mixer. Using the paddle attachment, beat
at low speed until mixture is smooth, about 3 minutes.
Gradually beat in remaining 2 1/4 cups cake flour to make a
soft dough. Continue beating at low speed until dough is
smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Dough will be soft. Turn dough out
onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth, 2
to 3 minutes, adding 2 to 4 tablespoons additional cake
flour. Be careful not to add too much flour. (If dough
begins to stick to surface, use a bench scraper to lift
dough from surface and add a dusting of flour. If your dough
is too soft to knead, chill covered for 2 hours or up to
overnight before kneading.) Shape dough into a ball.
Transfer to a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease
surface; cover. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in
size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough and turn out onto
floured surface. Roll dough into a 10x15-inch rectangle
about 1/2-inch thick. If dough springs back, let it rest an
additional 10 minutes. Lightly flour 2 large baking sheets.
Cut dough using 3-inch and 1-inch round cutters to create
doughnuts and doughnut holes. Arrange cutouts 1 inch apart
on the prepared baking sheets. Cover with a towel and let
cutouts rise in a warm place until very light and fluffy,
about 1 hour. [If you have scraps, gently knead together,
being careful not to overwork dough; let rest 10 minutes
before cutting.] Arrange wire racks in two 10x15-inch rimmed
baking pans (one for cooling, one for finished glazed
doughnuts). About 20 minutes before doughnuts are done
rising, pour oil to a depth of 2 1/2 to 3 inches into a
large skillet or a deep-fat fryer. Heat to 365 degrees F
(185 degrees C). Working in batches of 2 to 3 doughnuts,
fry, turning once halfway through, until golden, about 90
seconds. Transfer to prepared cooling rack to cool slightly.
Repeat with remaining doughnuts. For doughnut holes, working
in batches, fry, constantly moving with a slotted spoon,
until evenly golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to prepared
rack to cool slightly. Whisk together powdered sugar, melted
butter, vanilla extract and salt in a bowl to make the
vanilla glaze. Whisk in hot water, 1 tablespoon at a time,
until desired consistency. If glaze thickens, stir in
additional hot water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Dip warm
doughnuts and doughnut holes into vanilla glaze, turning to
coat both sides. Arrange doughnuts on the second prepared
rack to allow glaze to set, about 30 minutes.

Copycat Texas Roadhouse Rolls


Ingredients
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 oz. dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg yolk
2 large eggs
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
cooking spray
1 tablespoon water
cinnamon Honey Butter

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Heat milk in a small saucepan over
medium heat, stirring occasionally, until just bubbling
around the edges, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour
into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook
attachment. Stir in sugar and 4 tablespoons butter; let
cool, stirring occasionally, until mixture is between 110
degrees F and 120 degrees F (43 degrees C and 48 degrees C)
about 10 minutes. Stir in yeast; let stand until mixture is
foamy, about 10 minutes. Add salt, egg yolk, 1 egg, and 1/2
of the flour; beat on low speed until combined, about 1
minute. Still on low speed, carefully add remaining flour,
1/2 cup at a time, and beat until dough just comes together,
about 1 minute. Dough will be very sticky and wet. Increase
speed to medium, and beat until dough pulls away from sides
of bowl and dough is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.
Coat a large bowl with cooking spray; transfer dough to
prepared bowl. Cover loosely and let rise in a warm place
until about doubled in size, about 1 hour. With a clean
hand, punch down dough and turn dough out onto a lightly
floured work surface. Press or roll dough out into a
rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Trim edges with a sharp
knife to create a perfect 16- x 8-inch rectangle. Starting
at one long end, fold dough in half to form a 16- x 4-inch
rectangle; pinch to close dough halves together. Use a sharp
knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into 16 (2-inch) squares.
Place dough squares onto a parchment paper-lined baking
sheet about 1/2-inch apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap;
set aside at room temperature until about doubled in size, 1
hour. (It’s okay if the baking sheet looks a little
crowded.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk together remaining egg and water until combined. Brush
tops of rolls with egg wash. Bake in preheated oven until
golden brown, 12 to 16 minutes. Microwave remaining 2
tablespoons butter on HIGH until melted, about 30 seconds.
Immediately brush rolls with melted butter. Serve warm with
Cinnamon Honey Butter.

Flatbreads with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce


Ingredients
4 large red bell peppers
1/3 cup slivered almonds, toasted
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, plus leaves for garnish
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, smashed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 14.1 ounce) package flatbreads
2 cups shredded fontina cheese
1 cup shredded cooked chicken
1/2 cup kalamata and/or green olives

Perfect Pan Pizza


Ingredients
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 cup water
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
6 ounces part skim mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup pizza sauce (see below)
1/3 cup pepperoni

Cooking Instructions

Whisk flour, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir
water and 1 tablespoon olive oil together in a separate bowl
or measuring cup and add to flour mixture. Stir just until
well combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let stand at
room temperature until dough has tripled in size, 8 to 12
hours. Alternatively, cover and refrigerate at least 12
hours and up to 36 hours, or until dough has tripled in
size. Uncover dough and transfer to a floured surface.
Gently stretch and fold dough over a few times until nearly
smooth; use your hands to lightly shape dough into a ball.
Dough should remain a little sticky. Pour remaining olive
oil into a 12-inch cast iron skillet and use your fingers to
liberally coat the bottom and sides of the skillet. Using
oiled hands, transfer dough to the skillet, gently flatten
into a thick disc shape, and lightly coat with some of the
oil. Lightly cover the skillet with plastic wrap and set
aside at room temperature for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to
400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Use fingers to lightly press
dough to an even layer to the edges of the pan and about 1/2
inch up the sides. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese around the edges
and over dough. Sprinkle 1/3 cup shredded mozzarella over
dough. Spread pizza sauce in an even layer over entire
crust. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top with
pepperoni. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden
around the edges and cheese is lightly browned and melted,
20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on the
stove over medium heat. Cook until bottom of crust is golden
brown and toasted, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully slide pizza
from the pan to a wire rack; let stand for 10 minutes.

1 ½ tablespoons
1 (1/4-ounce) envelope active dry yeast
3 ½ cups
1 teaspoon
neutral cooking oil,
cooking spray
tablespoon
2 tablespoons hot water
2 cups part-skim mozzarella cheese
30 pepperoni slices
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
pretzel salt
1/3 cup whole milk
8 ounces processed cheese
1 tablespoon
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Prepare the pizza: Place warm water,
sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a
dough hook. Whisk until just combined, and let stand until
foamy, about 5 minutes. Add flour and salt; mix on low speed
until just combined, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to
medium, and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5
minutes. Shape dough into a ball, and transfer to a large
greased bowl, rotating dough to coat all sides in oil. Cover
with plastic wrap or a clean damp towel; let rest in a warm
area until doubled in size, 25 to 30 minutes. Preheat the
oven to 425 degrees F (230 degrees C) with a pizza stone or
overturned large rimmed baking sheet on the center rack.
Grease a large 15-inch pizza pan with cooking spray. Punch
down dough, and transfer to the prepared pizza pan. Using
clean hands, press dough to the outer edge of the pan (dough
should be 15 inches in diameter). Fold 1 to 1 1/2-inches of
dough’s outer edge over itself to create adefined crust
(dough should be 13 inches in diameter to the outer edge).
Combine baking soda and hot water in a small bowl. Using a
pastry brush, brush the top and outer edges of crust;
discard any remaining baking soda mixture. Bake crust on
pizza stone in preheated oven until crust is golden brown,
about 8 minutes. Meanwhile prepare the cheese sauce: Bring
milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium. Reduce
heat to low; add processed cheese, in batches, whisking
constantly until melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk in butter,
onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, and salt until smooth.
Set aside until ready to use. Spread cheese sauce evenly
over par-baked crust. Sprinkle with an even layer of
mozzarella cheese, and top evenly with pepperoni slices.
Brush outer crust with melted butter, and sprinkle evenly
with pretzel salt. Bake in the preheated oven at 425 degrees
F (230 degrees C) until mozzarella is slightly browned and
melted and crust is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove
from oven, and let cool on pizza pan for 5 minutes. Slice
and serve.

Sausage Gravy Kolaches


Ingredients
1/2 cup milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
1 package dry yeast
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 large egg
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour, plus more as needed
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
8 ounces ground pork breakfast sausage (or sausage links with casings removed)
1 1/2 teaspoons all purpose flour
4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
4 green onions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish
2 tablespoons milk
2 sage leaves, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne
1 large egg, beaten, divided

Cooking Instructions

Combine warm milk, yeast, sugar, salt, and melted butter in
the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attached. Add
egg and flour. Drop down dough hook and start kneading on
low speed, stopping and scraping down the sides every so
often in the beginning to make sure all the ingredients are
incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Once everything has come
together, increase speed 1 notch and continue kneading until
dough is very soft, very smooth, and slightly elastic, about
2 minutes. Transfer dough onto a work surface, knead for 1
minute, and shape into a smooth ball. Since the dough has
butter in it, it won’t be sticky. Return dough ball to a
lightly buttered bowl. Cover, and allow to rise in a warm
spot until it has doubled in size, about 90 minutes. Once
dough is risen, transfer to a work surface and punch down to
de-gas. Shape back into a ball, and weigh on a digital
scale. Divide amount by 8 and weigh out 8 equal dough
portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball, using just
enough flour to keep it from sticking. Press and flatten the
dough into a disc about 3 1/2-inches wide and a 1/2-inch
thick. Shape with your hands to make a small indention in
the middle. Transfer to a silpat-lined baking sheet. Cover
and let proof until almost doubles in size, 45 to 60
minutes. Combine cooled sausage, cream cheese, green onions,
milk, sage, ½ of the beaten egg, salt, pepper, and cayenne
in a bowl. Mix filling into a thick paste with a spoon.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) Use
slightly damp fingertips to press a well into the center of
each kolache to place the filling. Be sure to leave no more
that 3/4-inch of un-pressed dough around the outside. Do not
press all the way through the dough to the baking sheet.
Brush each kolache with remaining egg wash. Fill evenly with
the sausage cream cheese mixture. Bake in the preheated oven
until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven,
transfer to a wire rack, and allow to rest for 10 to 15
minutes before serving. Top with sliced green onions for
garnish.

Semla (Swedish Fat Tuesday Buns)


Ingredients
1 cup warm milk (95-100 degrees F)
1 package active dry yeast (2 teaspoons)
1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
2 cups all-purpose flour
7 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
⅔ cup powdered sugar
1 large egg
2 ½ teaspoons ground cardamom
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg
1 teaspoon water
14 ounces almond paste
½ cup powdered sugar
⅓ cup milk, or as needed to achieve desired texture
1 teaspoon ground cardamom, or to taste
1 ½ cups heavy cream, whipped
2 tablespoons powdered sugar for dusting

Cooking Instructions

Pour milk into the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle yeast on
top, followed by 1 1/3 cups flour and mix with a wooden
spoon. Allow to stand until foamy, about 20 minutes. Add
flour, softened butter, powdered sugar, egg, cardamom, and
salt; knead with dough hook (or by hand) until a soft,
smooth, elastic dough forms, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer dough
to a lightly floured surface and shape into a ball. Divide
into 12 equal portions. Using flour as necessary, roll dough
under a cupped hand to form perfectly smooth balls. Place
dough balls evenly on a parchment lined baking sheet,
leaving space in between and slightly push down. Dust tops
with flour, and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let rise
in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Preheat
the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Stir together egg
and water in a small bowl and brush rolls all over with egg
wash. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about
12 minutes. Transfer buns onto a wire rack and let cool
completely. Combine almond paste, powdered sugar, milk, and
cardamom in a food processor and blend almond filling until
smooth. Cut a triangle from the top of the buns, and remove
some of the crumbs to make room for the filling. Pipe almond
filling into each bun, and top with whipped cream. Place the
triangle on top and dust with powdered sugar before serving.

Sour Cream Donuts


Ingredients
2 ¼ cups bleached cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
¾ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
⅔ cup sour cream, room temperature
½ cup granulated sugar
2 large egg yolks, room temperature
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
vegetable oil as needed for frying
4 ½ cups powdered sugar
½ cup unsalted butter, melted
6 tablespoons hot water
1 ½ teaspoons light corn syrup
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon
together in a bowl until well combined. Whisk sour cream,
granulated sugar, egg yolks, melted butter, oil, and vanilla
together in a large bowl until well combined. Gradually fold
flour mixture into sour cream mixture just until combined.
(Dough will be quite soft and sticky.) Cover, and chill in
the refrigerator until dough is cold and just slightly
firmed, about 2 hours. Turn dough out onto a heavily-floured
surface and pat or roll to 3/8- to 1/2-inch thickness,
flouring hands or rolling pin as needed. Cut dough using a
floured 3 ½-inch round cutter. Cut holes in the center of
the dough circles using a floured 1 ¼-inch round cutter.
Transfer dough rings to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Reroll, and cut dough scraps, repeating process as needed.
Heat 3 inches of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat
until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F to 365
degrees F (182 degrees C to 185 degrees C). Fry 1 to 2
donuts at a time until golden brown and cooked through,
about 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side, adjusting heat as necessary
to maintain oil temperature. Transfer donuts to a baking
sheet lined with paper towels using a spider strainer. Let
drain, and cool for 5 minutes (see note). Whisk together
powdered sugar, melted butter, hot water, corn syrup, salt,
and vanilla in a large bowl for the glaze until smooth and
well combined. Place 1 warm donut in the powdered sugar
mixture, craggy side up; use a spoon to coat donut
completely in the glaze. Remove donut from glaze using two
forks placed underneath; let excess drip off, and then
transfer donut to a wire rack placed over a rimmed baking
sheet. Repeat with remaining donuts and glaze. Let donuts
stand until glaze is set before serving, about 25 minutes.

Triple Coffee Sweet Rolls


Ingredients
1/4 cup espresso powder
2 cups milk,
2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon espresso powder
1 tablespoon cocoa
1 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar
3 tablespoons espresso or strong coffee, or more as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine 1/4 cup instant espresso and hot milk in the bowl of
a stand mixer, and let cool until just warm to the touch,
about 95 degrees F (35 degrees C). Add yeast, egg, white
sugar, salt, and 6 tablespoons melted butter. Add most of
the flour, attach the dough hook, and knead on low speed
until everything comes together and begins to pull away from
the sides of the bowl. Turn mixer speed up a notch, and
continue to knead until a smooth, soft, elastic dough forms,
adding in remaining flour as needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove
dough from the mixer, form into a ball, and place back in
the bowl. Cover and let it rise in a warm place until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, make filling. Melt
1/2 cup butter in a small pan over medium heat. Stir in
brown sugar, cocoa, and 1 tablespoon instant espresso
powder. Once combined, remove from heat and let cool. As
soon as butter starts to cool and solidify, stir to form a
thick, spreadable paste. Reserve until needed. Once dough
has risen, use your hands to press out the air, and reshape
into a ball. For best results, transfer dough to a plastic
bag and place in the refrigerator overnight. Dough can be
used right away if need be. Very lightly flour a work
surface. Turn dough out onto the work surface, press into a
rectangle, and very lightly dust the top with flour. Roll
out into a 12x18-inch rectangle. Spread filling evenly to
the edges, leaving a few inches along one of the long sides
free of filling. Lightly brush exposed dough with water;
this will help to seal the seam. Beginning with the long
side that has filling, roll dough and filling toward the
long side with exposed dough to form a uniform log,
finishing with the seam on the bottom. Generously butter a
9x12- or 13-inch baking dish or pan, and, if desired, line
the bottom with buttered parchment. Score the log of dough
into 12 equal portions, and then cut each portion with a
piece of string as shown. Place cut rolls into the prepared
pan. Cover rolls and leave to rise in a warm spot until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375
degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until
puffed, golden brown at the edges, and an instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center, reads 200 degrees F
(95 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes
before icing. Whisk together confectioner’s sugar with 3 to
4 tablespoons of espresso or strong coffee, or enough to
form an icing that can be drizzled over with a spoon.
Drizzle icing over rolls and let cool before serving, or
enjoy slightly warm.

cheddar biscuits


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Combine mozzarella cheese and cream cheese in a large
microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave on high power
until slightly melted, about 45 seconds. Remove from
microwave and stir. Repeat, heating for about 20 seconds
more. Remove from microwave again and stir; consistency
should be very sticky and cheese should be completely
melted. Return to microwave, if necessary, until all cheese
is melted. Mix almond flour, eggs, baking powder, and garlic
powder together in a bowl. Add mixture to the large bowl
with melted cheese and mix well. Add Cheddar cheese and stir
into the dough. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on a flat
surface and dust lightly with almond flour. Pour dough onto
the middle of the plastic wrap and roll up to form a ball.
Place in the refrigerator until slightly hardened, 20 to 30
minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Grease a dark baking sheet with butter. Remove dough from
the refrigerator and cut into 8 equal-sized pieces. Roll
each into a ball and place on the prepared baking sheet,
spacing equally and avoiding the sides, as biscuits will
spread while cooking. Bake in the preheated oven until
golden brown, checking at 10 minutes. Remove from oven
immediately and cool completely before serving, about 15
minutes.

Roasted Butternut Squash Salad


Ingredients
1 medium butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
6 slices bacon
1 cup sliced onion
8 cups chopped romaine lettuce
⅓ cup pecans, toasted and chopped
⅓ cup raisins
2 tablespoons maple syrup, or to taste

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Brush cut
sides of butternut squash with olive oil. Wrap each squash
half tightly in aluminum foil. Roast squash halves in the
preheated oven until they begin to soften, about 20 minutes.
Remove squash from the oven and let sit until cool enough to
handle. Remove foil and slice into 3/4-inch thick slices.
Remove skin from each slice and cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Set
aside 8 cups of the cubed squash, reserving any remaining
squash for another use. Place bacon in a large skillet and
cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until
crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove bacon and drain on paper
towels. Add onions to the skillet and cook in the bacon
grease for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 8 cups squash and cook,
tossing occasionally, until onions are soft and beginning to
caramelize, and squash cubes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Place romaine lettuce in a large serving bowl; crumble bacon
on top and add pecans and raisins. Add butternut squash-
onion mixture; toss to combine. Drizzle with maple syrup and
serve warm.

Air Fryer Spinach


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Make filling: Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium
heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3
minutes. Add bell pepper and mushrooms; cook, stirring
occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Remove from
heat and stir in spinach and garlic; continue stirring until
spinach is slightly wilted. Season with Italian seasoning,
salt, and pepper. Let cool for 10 minutes. Stir in feta
cheese, breaking up any large pieces. Prepare chicken: Pat
chicken dry and place on a cutting board. Cut a pocket in
each breast by inserting a knife into the thickest part of
the breast and slicing parallel to the cutting board,
leaving about 1 inch at each tip. Be careful not to cut all
the way through the thinnest edge of the breast. Preheat an
air fryer to 370 degrees F (190 degrees C) if preheating is
recommended by the manufacturer. Separate prosciutto slices
and place onto a clean surface. Place 2 tablespoons filling
onto each slice; roll prosciutto around filling to create an
oblong bundle. Tuck one bundle into each sliced chicken
breast and close the opening with a few toothpicks. Place
beaten egg into a shallow bowl. Combine Parmesan cheese,
bread crumbs, parsley, salt, and pepper in another shallow
bowl. Dip each stuffed chicken breast into beaten egg, then
dredge in bread crumb mixture. Spray both sides with cooking
spray and place into the air fryer basket. Cook chicken in
the preheated air fryer until browned, about 15 minutes per
side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
of meat should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Chef Johns Tortilla de Patatas


Ingredients
2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or russet potatoes, peeled
1 yellow onion
5 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 cup olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Slice potatoes and onions with a very sharp knife or
mandoline into 1/8-inch thick slices. Combine eggs, 1/2
teaspoon salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl and
whisk very thoroughly; set aside. Add 1/3 cup olive oil to a
large nonstick pan and set heat to medium-high. Add
potatoes, onions, and remaining salt. Cook, tossing and
stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, and some
onions and potatoes are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
Between stirrings, cover potatoes to reduce cooking time and
keep in moisture. For less browning, reduce heat to medium.
Stir potato mixture into egg mixture with a spatula. Cover
and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Add remaining olive oil
to an 8- or 9-inch nonstick pan, and set the pan over
medium-high heat. Pour in egg and potato mixture, and smooth
the top. Cook, covered, for about 4 minutes or until the
bottom is browned and the edges of tortilla begin to firm
up. Slide tortilla out onto a plate, cover with another
plate, and flip the plates over to invert. Slide tortilla
back into the pan, and place back over medium-high heat.
Cook, uncovered, until the tortilla is fully set, about 2
minutes more. Tortilla will spring back lightly when pressed
in the middle with a finger if eggs are fully cooked. If it
feels soft or mushy when pressed, cook for a few minutes
more, unless you prefer the tortilla less than fully set.
Slip tortilla onto a serving plate, and serve hot, warm, or
room temperature.

Crescent Breakfast Squares


Ingredients
2 12x16-inch parchment paper sheets
2 (12 ounce) packages crescent roll dough (such as Pillsbury® Grands!™)
8 slices deli ham
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or more to taste
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
½ cup diced onion
½ cup diced red bell pepper
10 large eggs
1 tablespoon half-and-half cream or heavy whipping cream
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
8 slices Swiss cheese
1 tablespoon bagel seasoning (such as Trader Joe's® Everything But the Bagel Seasoning Blend)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread each
sheet of parchment on a work surface. Unroll crescent dough,
and place the contents of one can on each sheet. Roll dough
into two 10x15-inch rectangles, making sure the perforations
are sealed, one rectangle per parchment. Slide one dough
rectangle with its parchment paper onto a 13x18-inch sheet
pan; reserve the second rectangle for later use. Working
with the first piece of dough, spread ham slices over the
dough, leaving about 1/2-inch on all sides. Spread Dijon
mustard in a thin layer over the ham slices. Melt 1
tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook
and stir onions and bell peppers until slightly softened,
about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low; add 1 tablespoon
butter to skillet with vegetables until melted. Whisk eggs,
half-and-half or cream, salt, and pepper together in a large
bowl until well blended. Pour egg mixture into the skillet
with vegetables. Cook, using a spatula to lift and move,
until eggs are just set and still wet looking. Spoon lightly
cooked egg mixture in an even layer over the ham slices,
maintaining the 1/2-inch dough border all around. Place
sliced Swiss cheese in a single layer over the eggs. Place
the second dough rectangle over all, using the parchment to
help you align it. Carefully peel off the parchment. Moisten
fingertips and press the edges of the two dough rectangles
together, then use a fork to crimp. Melt remaining 1
tablespoon butter; brush over the top of the dough with a
pastry brush. Sprinkle bagel seasoning over all. Bake in the
preheated oven until nicely browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove to cool on a wire rack for about 15 minutes. Slice
into serving pieces with a sharp knife.

Halloumi and Zucchini Frittata


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large zucchini, grated and squeezed dry
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
4 large eggs
4 ounces halloumi cheese, sliced

Cooking Instructions

heat. Add zucchini and a pinch of salt and cook until soft,
about 5 minutes. Add chopped mint and dill, and cook 1
minute more. Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a small bowl.
Pour into the hot skillet with the zucchini and briefly
stir. Cook without stirring to allow the bottom of the
frittata to set, about 2 minutes. Use a spatula around the
edges of the skillet to ensure that the frittata isn't
sticking as the bottom starts to set. Set an oven rack about
6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's
broiler. Lay the slices of halloumi on the top of the
frittata as the edges start to set. Place the skillet under
the broiler until the top of the frittata is fully set and
cheese is slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Serve

Lemon Cheesecake Creme Brulee Croissants


Ingredients
6 large croissants
1 cup cheesecake filling, such as Philadelphia® Cheesecake No-Bak
1/4 cup lemon curd
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water

Cooking Instructions

Combine cheesecake filling, lemon curd and lemon zest in a
bowl; stir well. Add mixture to a piping bag or large zip-

paring knife to make a small cut into the side of each
croissant. Create an opening large enough to pipe the
filling into. Fill each roll with about 3 tablespoons of
filling. Place filled croissants on a wire rack set inside a
lined baking sheet to catch excess drippings. Add sugar and
water to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-
high heat. Reduce to medium low and cook, without stirring,
until lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove mixture
from the heat. Working very carefully, pour sugar syrup
evenly over prepared croissants to lightly coat rolls; let
stand until completely cooled and lightly hardened on top,
10 to 15 minutes.

Strawberry Rhubarb Drop Biscuits


Ingredients
1 1/4 cups rhubarb
1 1/4 cups strawberries
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stick unsalted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons fruit syrup
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 large egg (optional)
2 teaspoons water (optional)
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into
1/4-inch pieces; place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries
and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss to combine, cover, and let
fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Combine
flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing
bowl; whisk to combine. Drain fruit in a strainer set over a
bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices that pass through. Grate
frozen butter into the flour mixture, while stirring with a
fork several times to coat butter pieces with flour. Add 1/4
cup sugar, and drained fruit, mixing with a fork until fruit
is coated with flour. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved
fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk. Mix with a fork just
until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough.
If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little
more buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a
little more flour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230
degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat. Scoop or
spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking

Tres Leches Pancakes


Ingredients
2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/3 cup half and half
1 (15.25 oz) box French vanilla cake mix
1 1/4 cups almond milk
3 large eggs, lightly beaten
tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1/2 cup whipped cream, or as needed (optional) whipped cream, or as needed (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or as needed (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and half
and half in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring
to a boil, stirring constantly for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove

large bowl, and beat vigorously by hand for 2 minutes. Heat
a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and lightly
coat with remaining vegetable oil. Add 1/4 cup of the batter
for each pancake. Cook until edges begin to puff up, small
bubbles appear, pop, and leave small holes, 2 to 3 minutes.
Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on the other side,
about 2 minutes more. Serve pancakes warm with a drizzle of
the tres leches sauce, a dollop of whipped cream, and
sprinkle of cinnamon.

omelets


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Add eggs to a bowl, along with water, soy sauce, mirin,
salt, sugar, and cayenne. Use a fork to beat eggs until
whites are completely incorporated. Transfer egg mixture
into a pourable measuring cup. Set a 10-inch non-stick pan
over medium heat. Mix sesame and vegetable oil in a small
bowl, and use a brush to oil the pan. Pour in 1/3 of egg
mixture. Tilt the pan to cover the bottom with eggs. Cook
until omelet is about halfway set, then use a spatula to
turn over about 1 inch of edge toward the center on 3 sides
to square the shape on those 3 sides. If eggs seem to be
cooking too fast, reduce heat to medium-low. Use a spatula
to roll the omelet toward the rounder side, to form a
rectangular roll, about 2 inches wide by 8 inches long.
Slide omelet over to about 3 inches from the edge of the
pan, and brush more oil over the pan surface. Pour the
second 1/3 of eggs around the omelet. Lift omelet slightly
with the spatula so that some eggs flow underneath. Raise
heat back to medium, if it was reduced. When egg layer is
halfway set, use a spatula to roll this layer up and over
the already-folded omelet in the pan, and continue to roll
into a rectangle. Add remaining 1/3 of egg mixture, and
repeat cooking and rolling steps to make the final layer.
Transfer omelet onto plastic wrap, and use it to shape the
omelet, before wrapping and rolling it into a tight package;
cover with a towel and let rest for 5 minutes. Unwrap, slice
into 6 or 8 pieces, and serve on a warm plate. Sprinkle with
furikake.

German Rhubarb Almond Cake


Ingredients
6 cups peeled and chopped rhubarb
¾ cup white sugar
7 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
⅓ cup white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white wine
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 large egg
1 cup almond flour
¾ cup crème fraîche
2 tablespoons crème fraîche
⅔ cup white sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Cooking Instructions

For the rhubarb filling: Combine rhubarb and sugar in a
large bowl. Mix to combine and set aside to allow the
rhubarb to release some juice, about 1 hour. For the cake:
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light
and fluffy. Add flour, wine, baking powder, and egg; mix
together to form a dough. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and
place in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
9-inch springform cake pan. Roll dough out on a lightly
floured surface into a circle slightly larger than the
diameter of the cake pan. Transfer to the prepared cake pan,
letting the dough come up the sides by about 1 inch. Drain
rhubarb and evenly scatter over the dough; bake in the
preheated oven for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make the custard
filling: beat almond flour, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons crème
fraîche, sugar, eggs, vanilla sugar, and cinnamon together
until smooth. Remove cake from oven after 45 minutes; top
with almond custard mixture and use a spatula to spread it
evenly to the sides of the pan. Return cake to the oven and
bake until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes more. Allow

Hamburger Bun Bread Pudding


Ingredients
3 tablespoons butter
8 brioche-style hamburger buns
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
5 large eggs
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons whiskey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups milk
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon ketchup
1 teaspoon mustard
1 teaspoon mayonnaise
1/3 cup golden raisins (optional)
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup whiskey
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 pinch salt

Cooking Instructions

Butter a 9x12-inch or 9x13-inch baking dish with 3
tablespoons butter and set aside. If buns are not already
stale and relatively dry, split them open and spread out on
a baking sheet. Bake at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) until
very lightly toasted, about 20 minutes. Let cool. For
custard batter, combine eggs, white sugar, whiskey, vanilla,
cinnamon, salt, milk, cream, ketchup, mustard, and
mayonnaise in a bowl; whisk to combine. Lay 6 bun bottoms
into the prepared baking dish. Break last 2 bun bottoms and
1/2 of a top bun into large pieces and use pieces to fill in
the gaps. Ladle half of custard mixture over buns. Place 6
bun tops over bottom layer and use the last 1 1/2 top buns
to fill in the center gap. Ladle remaining custard mixture
over. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or
preferably up to 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Brush the tops of buns with some of the
custard mixture and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake in the
preheated oven until buns are browned and puffed up, about 1
hour. Remove to cool on a wire rack. For whiskey sauce, add
butter, whiskey, brown sugar, water, and a pinch of salt to
a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Turn off heat and let cool before using. Sauce will thicken
as it cools.

Perfect Cheesecake with Strawberry Topping


Ingredients
14 graham crackers
1/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, melted
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs
2 quarts fresh strawberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup water

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Break
graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor. Add sugar
and pulse until large crumbs form. Add butter and pulse just
until combined and mixture resembles slightly wet sand.
Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan; press mixture
lightly into the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of the
pan. Bake in the preheated oven until fragrant and slightly
golden brown around the edges, about 8 minutes. Let cool.
Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil. Place cream cheese
in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using a paddle attachment,
whip cheese on medium speed just until smooth, to avoid
incorporating too much air. Add sugar and beat until smooth,
scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add in sour
cream, vanilla, lemon juice and salt and blend until just
combined. With the mixer on low speed, add eggs, one at a
time, mixing until each egg is fully incorporated, then mix
until just combined and smooth, scraping down the sides of
the bowl as needed. Pour mixture into the prepared crust.
Wrap bottom and sides of pan well with heavy duty aluminum
foil. Place the pan inside a large deep roasting pan and set
pan in the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the
roasting pan around the cheesecake without letting any water
inside the foil wrap or the cheesecake. Bake in the
preheated oven until the center is very slightly jiggly,
about 50 minutes. Carefully remove pans from the oven and
allow cheesecake to cool in the water bath for 15 to 20
minutes. After about 10 minutes, just when cheesecake starts
to release itself from the sides, run a knife around the
sides. Remove wrapped cheesecake from water bath and place
on a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Unwrap
cheesecake and place in refrigerator until fully chilled and
ready to serve, at least 4 hours. Place 1/2 of strawberries
in a large saucepan and stir in sugar, lemon, vanilla,
cornstarch, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat,
stirring often. Reduce heat to medium high and allow mixture
to simmer until berries are softened. Using a potato masher,
mash strawberries until slightly chunky; continue to simmer
until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in
remaining strawberries, and let cool to room temperature.
Refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve cheesecake slices
with strawberry topping.

S'mores Cupcakes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
6 tablespoons brown sugar
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch cinnamon
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon espresso powder
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup brown sugar
1 large egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup sour cream
18 large marshmallows
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
2/3 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon almond extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2
cupcake pans with liners. Prepare the crust: Mix graham
cracker crumbs, melted butter, brown sugar, salt, nutmeg,
and cinnamon together in a small bowl until combined. Place
1 packed tablespoon of crumb mixture into the bottom of
about 18 cupcake liners and press into an even layer. Bake
in the preheated oven until graham cracker crusts are
slightly darker in color, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow crusts to
cool. Prepare cupcakes: Whisk boiling water, cocoa powder,
and espresso powder together In a small bowl or measuring
cup until smooth and combined. Set aside to cool slightly.
Beat butter, vegetable oil, and brown sugar in a large bowl
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3
minutes. Add in egg, vanilla, and salt. Beat for an
additional 3 minutes on medium-high speed. Add in cocoa
powder mixture and beat until thoroughly incorporated. Add
in cake flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and mix until
just combined. Add in sour cream; mix until just combined.
Spoon about 2 heaped tablespoons of cake batter over each
graham cracker crust, making sure to fill each liner no more
than 2/3 full. (There may be extra batter to make 1 or 2
extra cupcakes without a graham cracker crust. Simply put
that batter into an empty liner, filling no more than 2/3
full, and bake as a plain chocolate cupcake). Bake in the
preheated oven, 1 pan at a time, until tops of the cupcakes
spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow
cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before carefully
removing to a wire rack to cool completely. To prepare
frosting, place an oven rack directly below the oven's
broiler; preheat broiler. Line a baking sheet with parchment
paper and lightly grease it. Place large marshmallows about
1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Place pan under broiler
and cook until marshmallows are golden brown and puffy,
rotating the pan often to ensure the tops of the
marshmallows brown evenly without burning, about 1 minute.
Remove pan from oven and allow marshmallows to cool. Place
egg whites, white sugar, cold water, cream of tartar, and
pinch of salt in a very large heatproof mixing bowl. Place
the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water (do not allow
the bottom of the bowl to touch the water), and begin to
beat the mixture on low speed with an electric hand mixer.
Gradually increase speed to medium-high and continue to whip
mixture over hot water until mixture holds stiff peaks, 8 to
10 minutes. Remove from heat and beat for 1 minute more. Add
in toasted marshmallows, vanilla, and almond extract.
Beginning on low speed and gradually increasing the speed to
high, beat mixture until completely smooth and no lumps of
toasted marshmallow remain, and the mixture once again holds
stiff peaks, 5 to 7 minutes. Place mixture into a large
piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Generously pipe
marshmallow frosting onto the top of each cooled cupcake. If
desired, use a kitchen torch to caramelize the frosting
until golden brown.

needed to fit. Spread remaining 3 cups pudding mixture over
crackers. Store, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 8
hours or up to overnight. Before serving, top with remaining
2 cups sliced bananas. Drizzle with salted caramel sauce and
sprinkle flaky sea salt. Cut into slices and serve drizzled

filling each liner no more than 2/3 full. Bake one pan at a
time, until tops of cupcakes spring back when lightly
touched, 22 to 26 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan
for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool
completely, about 30 minutes Chill cupcakes in the
refrigerator for about 1 hour. This will make them easier to
cut and fill. Cream cheese whipped cream: Beat chilled cream
cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt together until
smooth. Add in 1/2 cup cold heavy cream, and mix on low
until mixture is smooth. Add in remaining heavy cream; beat
on medium-high until mixture holds stiff peaks. If desired,
place mixture into a piping bag fitted with an open star tip
(such as a Wilton® 1M). Place piping bag in refrigerator
until ready to use. Remove cupcakes from refrigerator.
Remove the liners and cut tops off cupcakes. Pipe a layer of
whipped cream on bottom half of cupcakes; top with about 1
to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. Place tops of cupcakes
back on, and lightly press down to adhere. Pipe more whipped
cream on top of cupcakes and top with another 1 to 2
teaspoons strawberry mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for
30 minutes before serving.

Strawberry Crumb Cake


Ingredients
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 ¾ cups white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
¾ cup unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes
1 cup buttermilk
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups hulled and halved strawberries

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a

combine. Trim tops of cakes with a serrated knife if needed
to make flat on top. Place 1 cake layer on serving platter;
spread evenly with 1 cup frosting. Top with remaining cake
layer. Spread top and sides of cake with the remaining
frosting. Sprinkle crumble mixture over top and sides of

These Copycat Choco Tacos Taste Just Like the Real Thing


Ingredients
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup egg whites
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup water
vanilla fudge swirl ice cream
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup unsalted peanuts

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Stand a thin hard cover book up
straight with the hard edge facing upwards. Drape a sheet of
parchment across the book (this is what you will use to
shape the shells). Line a plate with parchment paper. Heat
butter in a small saucepan over medium-low until melted, 2
to 3 minutes. Transfer the melted butter to a bowl, then
whisk in brown sugar, egg whites, vanilla to taste, and 1/2
teaspoon salt. Add flour and water. Whisk until the batter
is smooth and no clumps remain. Heat a non-stick skillet
over medium. Pour about 1 tablespoon batter into the pan;
spread into a thin layer with a spoon. Cook until browned on
the bottom and bubbles begin to form on top, 1 to 2 minutes.
Flip and cook until browned on other side, 1 to 2 minutes
more. Remove from pan and immediately drape over parchment-
lined book, pressing to help form that taco shell shape.
Transfer to a parchment-lined plate and repeat with
remaining batter. Let cool completely before filling.
Alternatively, preheat a waffle cone maker according to
manufacturer's instructions. Pour batter into the preheated
waffle maker and cook according to instructions. Remove from
pan and immediately drape across the parchment-lined book.
Let cool completely before filling. Remove ice cream from
the freezer and let soften for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile,
combine chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe
bowl; microwave in 30-second intervals, mixing well between
each, until mixture is melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in chopped peanuts. Carefully fill the taco shells with
the ice cream, pressing down gently to evenly distribute the
ice cream to the edges. Repeat with the remaining taco
shells. Place back on the parchment-lined plate. Dip the top
of each ice cream taco in the peanut-chocolate mixture to
completely coat the exposed ice cream. Return to the
parchment-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining tacos until
all are dipped. Once chocolate has hardened, carefully place
Choco Tacos in a sealable container or bag and return to
freezer.

banana pudding


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Separate eggs, placing the whites in the bowl of a stand
mixer and the yolks into a saucepan. Prepare the custard:
Add sugar, salt, and 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour to the
yolks. Splash in about 1/4 of the milk and start blending
mixture with a whisk. Pour in remaining milk and whisk until
smooth. Cook and stir mixture over medium heat until hot to
the touch, occasionally dipping your finger in to test.
Whisk constantly until custard is thick enough to form
ribbons. Remove custard from heat and add banana liqueur,
vanilla, then cold butter. Whisk until butter dissolves. Set
custard aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200
degrees C). Begin to assemble the pudding: Toss banana
slices with lemon juice. Spread 1/4 of the custard over the
bottom of a baking dish. Add a single layer of vanilla
wafers. Cover with 1/2 of the bananas and spread 1/2 of the
remaining custard on top. Add another layer of vanilla
wafers, using slightly fewer this time. Top with remaining
bananas and custard. Smooth the top and tap dish against the
counter to settle the pudding. Make the meringue topping:
Add cream of tartar to the egg whites. Beat using the whisk
attachment until foamy. Gradually add sugar and beat until
stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Spread meringue over the
pudding using a soft spatula, creating ridges for contrast.
Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is nicely browned,
7 to 10 minutes. Serve warm or chilled.
