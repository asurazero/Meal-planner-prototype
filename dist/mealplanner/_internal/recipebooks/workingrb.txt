Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup


Ingredients
1 pound bacon, chopped
2 stalks celery, diced
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes
3 tablespoons butter
Â¼ cup all-purpose flour
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook
over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper
towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease. Cook
celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion
is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic,
and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes,
and toss to coat. SautÃ© for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to
the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the
potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to
20 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet
over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly,
1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and
cilantro. Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring
constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream
mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine. Transfer
about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and purÃ©e. Return to the
Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve hot and enjoy!

Baked Burger Dogs


Ingredients
2 tablespoons melted butter or oil
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/3 cup red onion
1/3 cup diced dill or sweet pickles, well drained
6 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded, divided
8 hot dog buns

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a
large 15x10-inch casserole dish with 1 tablespoon melted
butter or oil. Add beef, salt, black pepper, garlic powder,
red onion, pickles, and 4 ounces shredded cheese to a bowl,
and use a fork to mix until all ingredients are evenly
combined. Divide beef mixture into 8 equal portions. Using
damp fingers, shape 1 portion into a log and gently press
onto the bottom of a hot dog bun. Lightly press bun
together, trapping the meat, and place stuffed bun in the
baking dish with meat facing straight up. Repeat until all 8
buns are stuffed. Brush all exposed areas of buns with
remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter or oil, and sprinkle
over remaining 2 ounces of cheese. Bake in the preheated
oven until meat is no longer pink at the center, and buns
are golden brown and crispy on the edges, about 25 minutes.
An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should

Ingredients
2 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloins
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 shallots, thinly sliced lengthwise
12 fresh figs, stemmed and halved
1 cup chicken broth
Â¼ cup good-quality balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary

Best Ever Cuban Sandwich


Ingredients
1/2 white onion
15 cloves garlic
3 oranges
3 limes
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 (5 pound) pork shoulder roast
1/4 cup butter, softened, divided
1 loaf Cuban bread,
2 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard
1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise
8 slices Swiss cheese
2 cups roast pork
12 ounces deli ham
12 sandwich-sliced refrigerated kosher dill pickles

Cooking Instructions

Prepare pork shoulder: Add onion, garlic, orange juice, lime
juice, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and salt into a food
processor or blender and process until smooth. Place pork in
the bottom of a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or large baking
dish and cut 3 or 4 large deep slits in the meat. Pour
marinade over pork, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator
4 hours or overnight. Place Dutch oven with prepared pork,
covered, in the oven and set the temperature to 325 degrees
F (165 degrees C). Bake until pork is very tender, 3 to 4
hours. Remove from the oven; rest 15 minutes. Remove pork to
a cutting board. Skim any fat from the cooking liquid, and
set cooking liquid aside. Shred pork with two forks, and
discard any remaining fat and bone. Return pork to the pot,
and add cooking liquid back into meat as needed to moisten.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat a
large skillet over medium heat. Spread about 2 tablespoons
softened butter over cut sides of bread and place bread,
buttered sides down, in skillet. Cook until buttered side is
lightly browned and toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir mustard
and mayonnaise together in a small bowl. Spread about 2
teaspoons mustard mixture over bottom halves of bread and
top with 1 slice of cheese, tearing as needed to fit the
bread without hanging over the edges. Using tongs or a
slotted spoon, add about 1/2 cup shredded pork to each
sandwich, draining off any excess liquid. Top each evenly
with ham, 3 pickle slices, and 1 cheese slice. Spread
remaining mustard mixture evenly over top pieces of bread
and place on top. Reheat the skillet over medium heat.
Spread about 1 tablespoon butter lightly on the outsides of
the 4 bottom buns. Working 2 sandwiches at a time, place
sandwiches, buttered side down, in skillet. Place 1 or 2
heavy-bottomed skillets on top of sandwiches to weigh them
down. Cook until toasted and lightly golden brown, 2 to 3
minutes. Remove weighted skillets. Spread remaining 1
tablespoon butter over the 4 top halves of sandwiches, flip
and press with weighted skillets again until toasted. Remove
the first 2 sandwiches from skillet; repeat the toasting
process with remaining sandwiches. Cut sandwiches in halves
and serve immediately.

Cherry Cola Ribs


Ingredients
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons mustard
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons cherry cola
1 (3 pound) rack baby back ribs, membrane removed
1 1/2 cups cherry cola
2 tablespoons ketchup
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste

Cooking Instructions

For dry rub, whisk salt, smoked paprika, onion powder,
garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a
small bowl; set aside. For wet rub, whisk mustard, vinegar,
and 2 tablespoons cherry cola together in a small bowl; set
aside. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Line a sheet pan with a piece of foil long enough to extend
past the rack of ribs by at least 6 inches on both ends. Use
large size, heavy-duty foil if possible. Place the ribs,
meat side up, on the foil. Brush wet rub over top and sides,
and sprinkle about 60% of dry rub over the surface. Turn
ribs over and, with the bone side up, brush with wet rub,
then sprinkle with all the remaining dry rub. Reserve any
wet rub left at this point. Center the ribs lengthwise on
the foil, and bring up the ends of the foil, like a boat,
and crimp so any juices will stay inside. Crimp the two long
edges together over the top of the ribs. The foil doesnâ€™t
have to be airtight, but the whole rack should be covered.
Bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours. Remove, open the
foil, and pour off juices that have accumulated in the foil
into a saucepan. Turn the rack meat side up, and brush with
wet rub. Enclose again in the foil, and continue to roast at
250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 1 hour. While meat is
cooking, add any remaining wet rub to the juices in the
saucepan, then add the 1 1/2 cups cherry cola, ketchup, and
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a simmer
on medium high, cook until liquid is reduced by half. Reduce
heat further, and simmer liquids very slowly until they
eventually thicken and become sauce-like. Once it is the
thickness of barbecue sauce, remove from heat entirely.
After one hour at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), remove ribs
from the oven, and open out the foil, pressing foil flat to
line the pan. Turn the oven temperature up to 300 degrees F
(150 degrees C). Brush ribs with sauce. Return ribs to the
oven for 15 minutes. Repeat this process, brushing ribs with
sauce every 15 minutes, until ribs are tender and come
easily off the bone, about 1 hour more. (See Note) Let ribs
rest for about 10 minutes. Slice between each rib with a
sharp knife, and serve with extra sauce.

Japanese-Style Triple-Seared Steak


Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) filet mignon
1 teaspoon avocado oil
3 tablespoons sea salt
1/3 cup Japanese whiskey
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon butter

Cooking Instructions

Before starting the triple-searing process, build a very hot
hardwood charcoal fire. Oak, mesquite or hickory are great
choices. The coals should be glowing red, and radiating
extreme heat before the meat hits the grill. Rub steak all
over with oil. Coat with sea salt until entire surface area
is completely covered. Pour whiskey into a shallow bowl; set
aside. Place steak on hottest spot on the grill, and sear
both sides, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer steak
into bowl of whiskey, and turn constantly for at least 1
minute. Most of the salt will rinse off. Place steak back
onto the hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides
again, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. You can baste steak
with a small amount of whiskey while searing. Add soy sauce
to another shallow bowl. Add steak to the bowl, and turn
constantly for at least 1 minute. Return steak to the
hottest spot on the grill for the 3rd and final sear. Grill
both sides for about 2 1/2 minutes, or until desired
doneness is reached. For a rosy-pink inside, remove when an
instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 118
to 120 F (48 to 50 degrees C). Brush steak with melted
butter, and let rest for 3 to 4 minutes. Slice and serve
with any accumulated juices from the plate.

Prosciutto-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with Crispy Sage


Ingredients
1 pound pork tenderloin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 bunch fresh sage, leaves removed and stems discarded, divided
6 ounces prosciutto
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
season pork with salt and black pepper. Arrange about 6 sage
leaves over tenderloin. Wrap prosciutto around tenderloin
and sage, overlapping prosciutto slightly; wrap in plastic
wrap and refrigerate to allow prosciutto to set on pork
tenderloin, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove plastic wrap. Heat olive
oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry wrapped tenderloin in
the hot oil until prosciutto is crispy and lightly browned
on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer wrapped tenderloin
to a baking dish, reserving oil in the skillet. Bake
tenderloin in the preheated oven until pork is cooked
through, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F
(63 degrees C). Heat reserved oil in the skillet over medium
heat; fry remaining sage leaves until crispy, adding more
oil as needed, about 5 minutes. Slice tenderloin and serve
with crispy sage leaves.

Roasted Pork Chops with Zucchini


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup rated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning blend
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 large egg
4 zucchini, quartered lengthwise, then halved crosswise
4 boneless pork chops
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
16 cherry tomatoes (optional)
4 parsley sprigs, or as needed (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and line
a 12x18-inch sheet pan with foil. Place a baking rack on top
of the foil. In a small bowl, combine panko bread crumbs,
Parmesan cheese, Italian herb seasoning, red pepper flakes,
granulated garlic, smoked paprika, and salt and pepper to
taste. Place 2/3 of the mixture on a plate, and set aside.
Break egg into a shallow bowl and beat until the white and
yolk are incorporated. Lightly brush each zucchini piece
with egg, and toss with 1/3 of the panko crumb mixture.
Place breaded zucchini on the prepared rack. Dip chops into
beaten egg and hold over the bowl to allow excess to drip
back into the bowl. Place each chop on the reserved panko
mixture, then turn and coat the other side with panko
mixture, gently patting mixture onto each chop. Heat olive
oil and butter together in a large skillet over medium heat
until butter is melted and no longer sizzling. Carefully
place each chop into the skillet and brown each side,
turning once, 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning once. Nestle
browned chops on the prepared rack with zucchini pieces.
Roast in the preheated oven until chops are no longer pink
at the center and zucchini is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. An
instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chops
should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove chops from
the oven and place on a serving plate. If desired, broil
zucchini pieces until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. See
Cookâ€™s Note. Garnish with cherry tomatoes and fresh parsley,
and serve warm.

Ronto Wrap


Ingredients
1 pound pork tenderloin,
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 garlic clove
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
pinch cayenne
pinch of cumin
kosher salt
4 pork sausages
1 12 ounce) coleslaw mix
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon jalapeno pepper
1 lime, juiced
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon osher salt
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup reek yogurt
1 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon orcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons peppercorns
Kosher salt to taste
4 pita or naan, warmed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the
trimmed pork tenderloin on a plate or work surface. Combine
olive oil, grated garlic, red pepper flakes, cayenne, and
cumin in a small bowl. Rub the oil and spice mixture all
over the pork, coating the entire surface, then season
generously with Kosher salt. Preheat a coated cast-iron
skillet over medium-high heat, about 2 minutes. Add pork
tenderloin and cook until deeply golden brown, about 5
minutes. Flip tenderloin over and cook for an additional 3
minutes. Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and roast
for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, push tenderloin to one
side of the skillet and add the sausages. Roast for an
additional 10 minutes, flipping sausages halfway through,
until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145
degrees F (62 degrees C). Remove skillet from the oven and
tent with foil to rest for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
combine coleslaw mix, cilantro, apple cider vinegar,
jalapeÃ±o, lime juice, freshly ground black pepper, and salt
in a bowl. Use tongs to toss the slaw so everything is
evenly mixed. Combine mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, lemon juice,
horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and kosher salt
in a small bowl for the peppercorn sauce. Taste and adjust
the seasoning according to your tastes. When ready to
assemble, wrap the pita or naan in foil and place in the
oven while you carve the pork to warm slightly. The oven
does not need to be on, the residual heat from roasting the
pork will be enough to warm the bread. Split the sausages
down the center lengthwise. Carve the pork tenderloin into
1/4-inch thick slices. To assemble, place a warm piece of
pita or naan on a large plate. Set down 4 to 5 slices of
pork tenderloin, and add a sausage on top. place about 1
loosely packed cup of the prepared slaw on top, then drizzle
without about 2 tablespoons of peppercorn sauce. Roll the
wrap up and enjoy.

Ingredients
4 pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided

2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup white wine
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, or to taste

fresh thyme sprigs for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Blot chops dry with paper towels and season both sides with
salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1
tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-
high heat. When butter sizzles, add chops and brown on both
sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chops from the
skillet and keep warm. To the same skillet, add remaining
olive oil and butter. When butter is melted, add onions,
mushrooms, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring, until
onions begin to turn translucent and mushrooms are softened,
4 to 5 minutes. Stir in minced garlic and cook until
fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chicken stock, wine, and
dried thyme, and bring to a boil. Return chops and any
accumulated juices to the skillet, nestling chops down into
vegetables and broth. Remove about 1/4 cup of broth for
later use. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until an
instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 145
degrees F (63 degrees C), 4 to 5 minutes. See note. Stir
cornstarch into the reserved cooking liquid, and stir until
there are no lumps. While stirring the skillet sauce, add
cornstarch mixture, and continue stirring 3 to 4 minutes, or

2 tablespoons olive oil
4 boneless pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick
2 teaspoons taco seasoning spice blend
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup onion
1 cup green bell pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 (10-ounce) diced tomatoes and green chilies

Cooking Instructions

Heat olive oil over medium heat in a 12-inch skillet. Season
both sides of pork chops with taco seasoning, cumin, smoked

turning once, until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes
per side. Remove to a plate, and keep warm. In the same

minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30
seconds. Pour in diced tomatoes and green chilies, with
their juices, and stir, being sure to scrape up any browned
bits on the bottom of the skillet. Add chili powder and
black pepper to the chicken broth, and stir in. Add thawed
corn kernels, sliced zucchini, and uncooked rice. Stir until

rice is submerged in the cooking liquid. Bring to a boil.
Nestle pork chops into the skillet contents, and add any
accumulated juices from the chops. Cover, reduce heat to
low, and simmer about 20 minutes. Remove cover, and continue
to simmer until rice is tender and all the liquid is
absorbed, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer

Air Fryer Smashed Potatoes


Ingredients
8 ounces baby gold potatoes
1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

you flatten the potatoes, the crispier they will be. Brush
melted butter over the tops of smashed potatoes. Season with
salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Place potatoes in the
basket of the air fryer in an even layer; cook until golden
and crisp, about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve
hot.

Big Fat Fondant Potatoes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon miso paste
1 1/2 teaspoons dashi powder
6 large russet potatoes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2/3 cup chicken broth

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring
chicken broth to a simmer; whisk in miso and dashi. Turn off
the heat; set aside until needed. Turn potatoes onto
narrowest side; trim straight down to create a flat surface.
Turn and trim the other side with a straight cut parallel to
the first. Cut a little off each end to square the potato a
bit more, then make 2 angled cuts on each side of the
squared ends. Transfer to a bowl of cold water. Reserve
trimmings for another use. Drain, and dry with paper towels.
Place a large cast-iron pan or other heavy ovenproof skillet
on high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil; place potatoes in
skillet with largest flat side down. Season tops with half
the salt. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook until well
browned, about 4 minutes. Turn potatoes over and repeat, to
salt and brown the other side, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat
to medium, and use a paper towel to soak up excess oil
between potatoes in the pan. Add butter, and as it melts,
baste tops of potatoes with melted butter. Once butter has
toasted to a light brown color, turn off the heat and strain
in the miso dashi broth. Roast potatoes, uncovered, in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Remove and turn
potatoes over. Add the 2/3 cup plain chicken broth, and
return to the oven to continue roasting at 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C) until potatoes can be pierced very easily
with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes more. Check occasionally to
see if broth has evaporated; add more as needed. Brush tops
of potatoes with pan drippings, and serve.

Ingredients
3 cups water
3 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 pound VEGETABLES)
1 bunch HERBS)
2 teaspoons peppercorns
3 cloves garlic,

Add a fermenting weight or an inverted, sanitized plastic
lid to keep vegetables submerged. Cover jar with a kitchen
towel, securing with a rubber band. Let stand at room
temperature for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days. Youâ€™ll
start to see bubbles forming. The vegetables will become
more tart and the brine will become cloudier the longer the
pickles stand. Remove fermenting weight and screw on metal
lid. Chill up to 3 weeks.

Green Goddess Pasta Salad Is the Only Thing We’re Bringing to Potlucks


Ingredients
16 ounces pasta
1 cup frozen peas
12 spears asparagus
2 green onions
1/2 cup feta
fresh herbs
1 cup baby spinach
1 cup fresh basil
1 chives
1 small shallot
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 cup raw cashews
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 lemons
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Bring a pot of heavily salted water to a boil over medium-
high heat. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook
according to package instructions, or until the pasta is al
dente. Drain the pasta. Transfer the pasta to a large bowl
to allow to cool. Meanwhile, combine spinach, basil, chives,
shallot, garlic, cashews, Parmesan cheese, nutritional
yeast, vinegar, and lemon juice in the container of a
blender. Pulse to start blending. Add olive oil in a stream
to emulsify to desired consistency. Season with salt and
pepper. Set aside. Steam peas and asparagus until they
slightly soften and become bright green, 2 to 3 minutes.
(You can opt to blanch your vegetables here as well, or
simply microwave with a little water for the same amount of
time.) Remove from heat, rinse with cold water, drain, and
transfer on top of the pasta along with the green onions.
Add the dressing over the pasta and vegetables and toss
gently to combine. You may or may not use all of it
depending on how coated you like the pasta. Add feta and
herbs, and taste for seasoning. Enjoy immediately or
refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.

Million Dollar Potato Salad


Ingredients
4 large eggs
3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes
1/2 cup dill pickle brine, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
6 slices bacon
1/3 cup chives
1/4 cup dill pickles
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/3 cup crispy fried onions

Cooking Instructions

Gather your ingredients. Place eggs into a small pot and
cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then
remove from the heat and cover with a lid. Let sit for 10
minutes. Drain eggs and place into an ice bath to cool
completely. Peel eggs and cut into quarters, or smaller if
you prefer. Peel potatoes and cut into roughly 2-inch
chunks. Add potatoes to a large pot of cold water, season
the water generously with salt, and add 1/4 cup pickle juice
(this helps them to hold together once cooked - you can
alternatively use 2 tablespoons white vinegar). Bring to a
boil over a high heat, reduce the heat, and simmer until
potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes and
set aside. Meanwhile, make dressing: Stir Parmesan,
mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, and remaining 1/4 cup dill
pickle brine together in a bowl. Pour the dressing over the
hot potatoes and stir to coat. Taste and season with salt,
if needed, then leave to cool. Place bacon into a large
skillet and fry over medium heat, turning over to let both
sides crisp up, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove to a chopping board
and cut into bite-sized pieces. To the cooled potatoes, add
the boiled eggs, celery, chopped dill pickle, most of the
bacon and most of the chives. Mix together to combine. When
ready to serve, transfer the potato salad to a serving dish
and garnish with remaining chives and bacon, as well as the
crispy fried onions.

3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon italian seasoning
2 teaspoons garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
2 pounds head cabbage

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230
degrees C) with racks in top third and lower third

Parmesan mixture on one side of each cabbage wedge (about 2
tablespoons per wedge) and arrange, paste side down, on the
prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until
cabbage is tender-crisp and Parmesan creates a golden brown
crust on bottom of cabbage, 16 to 18 minutes, rotating pans
between top and bottom racks and from front to back halfway
through. Remove cabbage from oven, and let stand undisturbed
for 2 minutes, before using a spatula to release cabbage
wedges from baking sheets. Turn cabbage wedges over, cheese
side up; and bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) until
cabbage is tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve hot.

Roasted Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce


Ingredients
1 pound asparagus,
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 large egg yolks
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon water
1/2 cup butter
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
1 large hard boiled egg, peeled
1 tablespoon chives (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Place asparagus on
the prepared pan and drizzle olive oil over the spears.
Season with salt and pepper. Using clean hands, toss
asparagus spears until evenly coated with olive oil and
seasonings, then spread asparagus in a single layer on the
pan. Roast in the center of the preheated oven until fork-
tender, 10 to 12 minutes; thicker asparagus may require more
time. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, and water
together in a heavy saucepan or small skillet with a wire
whisk until well blended. Season with salt and pepper. Turn
heat to medium-low; and whisk continuously, being careful to
stir the entire bottom and sides of the pan, until eggs
begin to thicken slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. If eggs start to
curdle, remove pan from heat, and continue whisking briskly
and continuously until any lumps disappear. Gradually whisk
in hot melted butter, about a tablespoon at a time, whisking
briskly after each addition. Adjust salt and pepper, if
necessary, and stir in cayenne pepper. When whisking, each
stroke of the whisk should reveal the bottom of the pan. If
the sauce is too thick, whisk in a drop or two of water or
lemon juice. To serve, plate asparagus and pour Hollandaise
sauce on top. Grate hard-boiled egg over Hollandaise, and
garnish with snipped chives.

Steamed Bok Choy


Ingredients
1 pound baby bok choy
1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for drizzling
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons shallots
2 tablespoons white vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
4 lime wedges

Cooking Instructions

Remove any discolored outer leaves from baby bok choy, trim
the bottom of the stalks, and slice in half lengthwise.
Bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer over medium heat in
a large pot with a steamer basket. Arrange bok choy in the
basket, cut side up. Cover; steam until stems are tender, 4
to 7 minutes, depending on the size of the stalks. To check
for tenderness, insert the tip of a knife into the stem.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium-low
heat. Add garlic and shallots, cook for about 1 minute, stir
in vinegar, and cook for 1 additional minute. Transfer bok
choy to a plate, spoon garlic mixture over the top, and
drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, and
serve with a wedge of lime.

Ultimate Lowcountry Shrimp and Grits


Ingredients
4 cups water
1 cup milk
3 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/4 cups grits
2 ears white sweet corn
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
6 slices bacon
1 onion
4 green onions, divided
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
4 ounces okra, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cloves garlic
2 tomatoes
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, or to taste (optional)
2 cups peanut oil or other vegetable oil for frying
3 large eggs
1 1/2 pounds shrimp,
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 green onions, thinly sliced
chopped parsley for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine water, milk, butter, and salt in a large saucepan
and bring just to a boil. Whisk in grits until incorporated.
Reduce heat to simmer, cover, and cook until thick, 25 to 30
minutes, stirring often. If mixture gets too thick, add a
little more milk or water. Cut kernels off corn cobs, and
using the back of the knife, carefully scrape the cob to
release the creamy corn milk. Stir corn kernels and corn
milk into grits and continue cooking until grits are creamy
and tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer, stirring often. Stir in
pepper and adjust seasonings if necessary. Meanwhile, heat a
large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add olive
oil and bacon slices in a single layer, and cook until bacon
is crisp, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Remove
bacon from the skillet, drain on paper towels, and set
aside. Crumble bacon once cool enough to handle. Reserve
drippings in the skillet and return skillet to medium-high
heat. Finely slice green onions and reserve green ends for
garnish. Add white parts of green onion, onion, green and
red bell peppers, and okra to the skillet and cook until
softened and lightly browned, stirring often, about 5
minutes. Add in salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne and
cook for 1 minute. Add fresh tomatoes and garlic, and cook
for 2 minutes. Add butter to mixture and allow it to melt.
Sprinkle flour over skillet and cook, stirring constantly,
about 1 minute. Add in tomatoes, with juices, and stock
while stirring constantly until smooth. Stir in sugar,
Worcestershire, and hot sauce, and return mixture to a
simmer. Cook gravy for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Heat peanut oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large,
deep skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs in a bowl;
add shrimp and stir to coat. In a shallow dish, whisk flour,
salt, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Working a
few at a time, remove shrimp from egg, allowing excess to
drip off, and lightly coat in flour mixture. Transfer shrimp
to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with
remaining shrimp. Working in batches, add shrimp to hot oil
and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned and
crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on a wire rack set over a paper
towel-lined baking sheet. To serve, place grits in the
bottom of a shallow bowl. Top with about 1/2 cup of gravy
and 6 to 8 shrimp. Top with crumbled bacon, and sprinkle
with green onions and parsley if desired.

Wet Wet Sauce


Ingredients
1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons ginger
3 tablespoons Korean chili flakes
2 teaspoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
3 tablespoons rice vinegar

Cooking Instructions

Add scallions, garlic, ginger, chili flakes, sesame seeds,
and sesame oil to a heat-safe bowl with plenty of room left
to add more ingredients. Heat neutral oil over medium-high
heat in a small saucepan until hot, about 5 minutes. Pour
hot oil carefully over green onion mixture. It will bubble
up, so pour slowly. Once the bubbling stops, stir the
mixture and allow to cool slightly. Stir in soy sauce,
oyster sauce and vinegar. Transfer mixture to a jar or
container with a tight fitting lid and refrigerate until
ready to use.

Cooking Instructions

Soak cashews in 1 1/2 cups water in a bowl until softened,
at least 20 minutes. Drain water; add almond milk. Blend
mixture in an electric blender or food processor until
smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup water, or as
needed, until sauce is slightly thinner than you want it for
the final product, as it thickens when heated. Add garlic,
nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; blend
until smooth. Pour mixture into a saucepan. Heat on medium-
low heat, stirring occasionally until heated through and
desired thickness is achieved, about 5 minutes. You can add
additional water or almond milk if sauce becomes too thick.

asparagus


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over
medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper
towel-lined plate. Crumble bacon when cool; set aside.
Reserve 1 tablespoon of bacon drippings. Melt butter with
drippings in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir
celery and onion in the saucepan until onion is translucent,
about 4 minutes. Whisk flour into the mixture and cook for 1
minute. Whisk in chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add
potato and chopped asparagus stalks, reserving the asparagus
tips for later. Season with salt and ground black pepper.
Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Pour the soup into a
blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold
down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and
carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get
the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in
batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately,
you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the
cooking pot. Cook and stir mushrooms and asparagus tips in
the same skillet used for bacon until mushrooms give up
their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and ground
black pepper, if needed. Stir mushrooms, asparagus tips, and
half-and-half cream to pureed soup. Cook until thoroughly
heated. Garnish soup with crumbled bacon.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). (If using a
countertop induction oven, preheat on the "Combo 3"
setting). Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10
minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into
small pieces. Toss potatoes with vegetable oil to coat;
season with salt and pepper. Spread potatoes on a baking
sheet. Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender,
about 30 minutes in the conventional oven and 20 minutes in
the countertop induction oven. Cool potatoes until easily
handled, about 5 minutes. Slice off the top 1/4 of each
potato lengthwise. Scoop flesh into a bowl using a melon
baller or small spoon, leaving about 1/8 inch of flesh on
the skin. Mash melted butter and mascarpone cheese into the
potato flesh in the bowl. Beat with a hand mixer until
fluffy, about 30 seconds. Stir in bacon, green onions, and
Cheddar cheese. Fill potato skins with potato mixture;
return to the baking sheet. Bake filled potatoes in the
preheated oven until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Turn
on the oven's broiler; broil potatoes until cheese is bubbly
and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the oven. Season
shrimp with Creole seasoning; transfer to a grill pan. Grill
shrimp over high heat until opaque, about 3 minutes. (If
using a countertop induction oven, cook shrimp on the "Grill
setting" until opaque, about 3 minutes.) Top each potato
with 1 shrimp.

Cheese and Potato Stuffed Flatbread


Ingredients
2 russet potatoes
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon melted butter
2 tablespoons green onions (optional)
2 tablespoons green chilies (optional)
4 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into very small cubes
1 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese
3 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter, divided
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon hot chili pepper flakes
1 tablespoon green onions (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place
potatoes in a baking dish, and pierce skins several times
with a knife. Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until very
tender when tested with a knife, about 1 hour. Remove from
the oven, cover with a towel, and cool potatoes to room
temperature, about 30 minutes. Turn oven off. Place flour in
a bowl, and make a small well in the center with a fork.
Pour milk, water, and salt into the well, and stir with a
fork to form a shaggy dough. Pour in the 1 tablespoon melted
butter, and continue to mix with a fork until dough begins
to come together. Lightly flour your hand and knead in the
bowl until the sides of the bowl are clean, and dough forms
into a ball. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work
surface and knead until dough is smooth and slightly
elastic, 2 to 4 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and set
aside to rest for 15 to 30 minutes. Measure out 8 ounces of
cooled, cooked potato; add to a bowl and mash with the back
of a fork, until slightly chunky or completely smooth, as
desired. Add green onions, green chilies, mozzarella,
Cheddar, and feta cheese and stir thoroughly to combine.
Season with salt and pepper. Mash filling into a compact
disc, about 5 inches in diameter, in the bottom of the bowl.
Turn filling out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap tightly,
give filling a final shaping, and place in the refrigerator
until ready to use. Roll dough out on a well-floured work
surface into a 10- to 11-inch circle. Place chilled filling
disc in center of dough circle. Working around the circle,
fold dough up toward the center to cover filling completely,
pleating dough as needed and using a moistened finger to
stick dough together where it overlaps. Flour the top, and
flip over so the seam side is down. Again, flour the top of
filled dough, and roll gently into an even circle, 3/4- to
1-inch thick. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick
skillet over medium heat. Gently place filled bread in the
skillet and cook, covered, until the bottom is a light
golden brown, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip over, and
cook, covered, until the other side is golden, about 5
minutes. Turn bread back over, and brush top and sides with
remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter. Cook for 1 to 2
minutes more. If flatbread begins to bulge, poke a small
hole with a knife to release steam. Transfer to a cutting
board and cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stir honey
and pepper flakes together in a small bowl. Sprinkle
flatbread with green onions, cut into wedges, and serve with
spicy honey.

Ingredients
2 cups cornmeal
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 cups water
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
3 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

Green Onion Garlic Naan Bread


Ingredients
1 Â½ cups bread flour, plus more as needed
Â½ teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup plain Greek yogurt
4 cloves garlic, crushed
Â½ cup thinly sliced green onions
2 tablespoons melted butter

Cooking Instructions

Place bread flour in a bowl. Add salt and baking powder and
give it a good whisk until evenly combined. Add in Greek
yogurt gently, followed by garlic and green onions. Take a
wooden spoon and slowly start mixing everything together.
Keep mixing, stirring, and pressing until a shaggy dough
forms. Transfer dough to a work surface and use your hands
to press dough together. Knead for a few minutes until dough
becomes elastic and a little bit sticky. Add a bit more
flour as necessary but try to keep extra flour at an
absolute minimum. Knead until dough is a little bit
stretchy, 3 to 5 minutes. Wrap in plastic and allow to rest
on the counter for 15 to 20 minutes. Take a bench scraper
and cut into 6 equal pieces. Take 1 portion and roll into a
ball. Place onto a generously floured surface. Use a rolling
pin to roll out nice and thin, about 1/8 inch or less. It's
ok if the naan is not a perfect circle. You will need extra
flour for rolling out as the dough is sticky, but try to use
as little as possible. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-
high heat until hot. Transfer dough circles into the hot dry
skillet and cook until little bubbles form on the surface
and the underside is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Flip
naan over and cook for 1 more minute. Press down slightly
with a spatula to increase the heat during cooking. Flip
over twice more and cook for an additional 15 seconds per
side, but make sure not to overcook to preserve the texture.
Naan should still be flexible when you remove it from the
skillet onto a plate. Cover with a kitchen towel to keep
warm and moist while you cook the other naan breads. Stack
all 6 naan breads on top of each other and keep covered with
a kitchen towel. When you are finished cooking all 6 naan
breads, unstack breads and brush the first naan bread on
both sides with a little bit of melted butter. Stack second
piece of naan on top and only brush the top side. Keep
stacking and buttering all the naan breads. Fold each naan
into a triangle and serve.

How to Make Sourdough Bread with Levain


Ingredients
100 grams sourdough starter
15 grams bread flour
15 grams whole wheat flour
5 grams rye flour
35 grams water
135 grams whole wheat flour
365 grams bread flour
425 grams water
70 grams of the levain
11 grams kosher salt
2 tablespoon rice flour, or as needed for dusting banneton
2 ice cubes

Cooking Instructions

Make the Levain: Weigh out the levain ingredients in a small
bowl or jar (100g sourdough starter, 15g bread flour, 15g
whole wheat flour, 5g rye flour, 35g water). Stir together,
and leave at room temperature until very bubbly and doubled
in size, about 5 hours. Meanwhile, about 2 hours before the
levain will be ready, perform the autolyse: Stir the 135g
whole wheat flour, 365g bread flour, and 425g water together
in a bowl. Let sit for about 2 hours. If levain is ready to
use before the autolyse has gone a full 2 hours, proceed
with mixing dough anyway. Mix the dough: Weigh out 70g
levain, and add to the top of the autolyse mixture of flour
and water. Sprinkle salt around the edges. With damp hands,
pull up and fold dough from edges to the middle, turning the
bowl as you fold, until completely mixed. Cover; let rest
for 15 minutes. Cover and return the excess levain to the
refrigerator to use for a future batch of bread. Perform
first set of folds: Lift dough with wet hands at the edge
and flop to the middle; turn the bowl a few inches and
continue to flop and turn until dough begins to resist being
pulled to the center. Repeat folds twice more, 15 minutes
apart, covering dough in between. Set a timer for 30
minutes. Now turn dough out onto counter, and perform the
first stretch and fold. Stretch the dough into a rough
12-inch square. Pull 2 corners and fold the dough into
thirds; then fold the top half to the bottom. Roll the dough
forward, then form into a ball with a flat bench scraper;
return dough to the bowl and cover. Repeat the stretch and
fold process 2 more times, 30 minutes apart. Cover; let
dough bulk ferment until very bubbly and doubled in size, 4
to 5 hours. Turn dough out onto counter, and pre-shape dough
into a ball. Dust with flour, and let rest on the counter 30
minutes. Perform the final shaping: Dust the counter with
flour, and gently flop the dough over into the flour with
the bench scraper. Again, perform a stretch and fold, but
gently, to not deflate the dough. Shape into as high and
round a ball as possible using the bench scraper. Dust the
top with flour. Generously dust a banneton with rice flour,
Carefully slide the bench scraper under the dough, and turn
it over into the banneton. Now, and this is optional,
"stitch" the dough by bringing opposite pieces of the dough
up, sticking them together in the center. Dust with a little
flour. Cover; proof dough in the refrigerator for 14 hours.
One hour before baking, place the pan you will bake the
bread in, or a pizza stone, in the oven. and heat the oven
to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). After 1 hour of
preheating, turn dough out of banneton onto parchment, and
score 1/4-inch deep with a razor or sharp thin knife. Place
in bread pan, add 2 ice cubes to the pan; cover. Bake for 20
minutes at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Remove cover,
lower the heat to 450 degrees F (240 degrees C), and bake an
additional 35 minutes, or until desired doneness. Let cool 1
hour before slicing.

Iced Dried Cherry Biscuits


Ingredients
2 1/4 cups flour, plus more for rolling
3/4 cup dried cherries
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons orange zest, plus more for garnish
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon sea salt
stick (8 tablespoons) butter
3/4 cup Greek-style yogurt
1/2 cup orange juice, or more as needed
1 cup sifted powdered sugar
5 teaspoons whole milk
1/8 teaspoon sea salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C). Line a
large baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together
flour, dried cherries, sugar, baking powder, orange zest,
baking soda, and fine sea salt in a large bowl. Coat whole
stick of butter in the flour mixture. Grate butter on the
large holes of a box grater into bowl. If butter starts to
melt, coat butter in flour mixture again and continue
grating. Use your fingers to toss butter in flour mixture
until all butter pieces are separated and coated in flour.
Mixture should resemble coarse crumbs. Whisk together yogurt
and orange juice in a small bowl; add to flour mixture.
Gently fold to bring dough together. Dough should be
moistened but still crumbly. If dough is too dry, add more
cold orange juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, until fully
moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work
surface. Lightly knead three or four times until dough comes
together. Sprinkle with flour; pat to 3/4 inch thickness.
Cut dough into four equal portions. Stack portions, press
down, and pat again to form a 3/4-inch-thick rectangle.
Repeat process three times, adding flour as needed. Press a
2 1/2- to 3-inch biscuit cutter straight down into dough to
cut out biscuits. Gently knead scraps together, pat to
3/4-inch thickness, and repeat cutting. Arrange on prepared
baking sheet (biscuits should be barely touching). Bake
until tops are crisp and golden brown, 15 to 16 minutes. Let
cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Stir together
powdered sugar, milk, and 1/8 teaspoon sea salt in a bowl
until icing is well combined. Drizzle biscuits with icing;
garnish with more orange zest. Store in an airtight
container up to 3 days; chill up to 1 week. To reheat, bake
about 10 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Mochi Donuts


Ingredients
1 Â½ cups Mochiko (sweet white rice flour, such as Asianâ€™s Best), plus more for dusting
1 cup tapioca flour
Â½ cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt
â…” cup whole milk
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg
canola oil for frying
1 Â¼ cups powdered sugar
2 tablespoons whole milk, or more as needed
Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon ground freeze dried fruit such as strawberry, mango or dragon fruit

Cooking Instructions

Combine rice flour, tapioca flour, sugar, baking powder, and
salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle
attachment. Beat on low speed until combined, 1 minute. Add
milk, butter, vanilla, and egg; beat on low speed until a
smooth dough forms about 1 to 2 minutes (dough will be
slightly sticky). Lightly dust rice flour onto a clean work
surface and turn dough onto surface. Divide dough into
quarters and working in batches, roll dough quarters into
18-inch-long ropes about 1-inch wide. Cut each rope into
1-inch pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, wetting hands as
needed to help roll (about 72 each for 9 donuts). Cut 9
square pieces of parchment paper, 5x5-inches, and place in a
single layer on a baking sheet. Arrange 8 dough balls onto
each piece parchment in a ring about 3 1/2 inches in
diameter, connecting them side by side and using water to
seal together. Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large
Dutch oven; heat over medium-high to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Place 3 dough rings, along with parchment, in
hot oil. Remove parchment with tongs once dough floats to
top of oil. Cook until golden and puffed, turning once
halfway through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack
lined with paper towels; cool 10 minutes. Repeat with
remaining dough rings. For the glaze whisk powdered sugar, 2
tablespoons milk, and vanilla together in a medium bowl.
Mixture should be the consistency of heavy cream; add up to
1 tablespoon milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, as needed to adjust
consistency. Dip tops of 4 or 5 doughnuts into the glaze;
place on wire rack (with paper towel removed). Stir 2
teaspoons dried fruit powder into remaining glaze. Dip
remaining doughnuts in the glaze; transfer to wire rack and
sprinkle with remaining fruit powder.

rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 22 to 25
minutes. While rolls are baking, prepare the frosting.
Combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, orange zest, orange
zest, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the
paddle attachment. Beat at medium-high speed until very
smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove rolls from oven
and transfer to a wire rack. Let cool 2 minutes, then spread
frosting evenly over the rolls. Serve warm.

Dough should remain a little sticky. Pour remaining olive
oil into a 12-inch cast iron skillet and use your fingers to
liberally coat the bottom and sides of the skillet. Using
oiled hands, transfer dough to the skillet, gently flatten
into a thick disc shape, and lightly coat with some of the
oil. Lightly cover the skillet with plastic wrap and set
aside at room temperature for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to
400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Use fingers to lightly press
dough to an even layer to the edges of the pan and about 1/2
inch up the sides. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese around the edges
and over dough. Sprinkle 1/3 cup shredded mozzarella over
dough. Spread pizza sauce in an even layer over entire
crust. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top with
pepperoni. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden
around the edges and cheese is lightly browned and melted,
20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on the
stove over medium heat. Cook until bottom of crust is golden
brown and toasted, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully slide pizza
from the pan to a wire rack; let stand for 10 minutes.

Pretzel Crust Pizza


Ingredients
1 Â¼ cups warm water
1 Â½ tablespoons
1 (1/4-ounce) envelope active dry yeast
3 Â½ cups
1 teaspoon
neutral cooking oil,
cooking spray
tablespoon
2 tablespoons hot water
2 cups part-skim mozzarella cheese
30 pepperoni slices
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
pretzel salt
1/3 cup whole milk
8 ounces processed cheese
1 tablespoon
Â½ teaspoon onion powder
Â½ teaspoon paprika
Â½ teaspoon
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Prepare the pizza: Place warm water,
sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a
dough hook. Whisk until just combined, and let stand until
foamy, about 5 minutes. Add flour and salt; mix on low speed
until just combined, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to
medium, and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5
minutes. Shape dough into a ball, and transfer to a large
greased bowl, rotating dough to coat all sides in oil. Cover
with plastic wrap or a clean damp towel; let rest in a warm
area until doubled in size, 25 to 30 minutes. Preheat the
oven to 425 degrees F (230 degrees C) with a pizza stone or
overturned large rimmed baking sheet on the center rack.
Grease a large 15-inch pizza pan with cooking spray. Punch
down dough, and transfer to the prepared pizza pan. Using
clean hands, press dough to the outer edge of the pan (dough
should be 15 inches in diameter). Fold 1 to 1 1/2-inches of
doughâ€™s outer edge over itself to create adefined crust
(dough should be 13 inches in diameter to the outer edge).
Combine baking soda and hot water in a small bowl. Using a
pastry brush, brush the top and outer edges of crust;
discard any remaining baking soda mixture. Bake crust on
pizza stone in preheated oven until crust is golden brown,
about 8 minutes. Meanwhile prepare the cheese sauce: Bring
milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium. Reduce
heat to low; add processed cheese, in batches, whisking
constantly until melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk in butter,
onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, and salt until smooth.
Set aside until ready to use. Spread cheese sauce evenly
over par-baked crust. Sprinkle with an even layer of
mozzarella cheese, and top evenly with pepperoni slices.
Brush outer crust with melted butter, and sprinkle evenly
with pretzel salt. Bake in the preheated oven at 425 degrees
F (230 degrees C) until mozzarella is slightly browned and
melted and crust is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove
from oven, and let cool on pizza pan for 5 minutes. Slice
and serve.

Reuben Crescent Rolls


Ingredients
2 (8-count) cans crescent rolls
8 thin slices pastrami or corned beef
4 slices Swiss cheese
1 cup sauerkraut
8 teaspoons thousand island salad dressing
1 large egg, beaten
2 teaspoons caraway seeds

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and line a
sheet pan with parchment paper. On a cutting board or work
surface, separate crescent rolls into 16 triangles, lining
them up so that the thin points of the triangles point away
from you. Cut each slice of pastrami or corned beef
diagonally, into 2 triangles, making 16. Cut each Swiss
cheese slice in half, then cut each half diagonally, to make
16 triangles. For each triangle of crescent dough, place a
triangle of meat and shape it to be slightly smaller than
the crescent dough. Add a triangle of Swiss cheese. Place 1
tablespoon sauerkraut along the bottom edge of each
triangle. Add 1/2 teaspoon Thousand Island salad dressing on
top of the sauerkraut. Roll the crescents away from you,
beginning at the wide end and rolling to the narrow point,
the same way a crescent roll is made, keeping the filling
ingredients inside the dough as it rolls. Place each
completed roll on the prepared pan. Brush each roll-up with
egg, and sprinkle with caraway seeds. Bake in the preheated
oven until golden brown and hot throughout, 21 to 25
minutes. Remove to cool on a baking rack for 3 to 5 minutes.
Serve warm.

Sausage Gravy Kolaches


Ingredients
1/2 cup milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
1 package dry yeast
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 large egg
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour, plus more as needed
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
8 ounces ground pork breakfast sausage (or sausage links with casings removed)
1 1/2 teaspoons all purpose flour
4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
4 green onions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish
2 tablespoons milk
2 sage leaves, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne
1 large egg, beaten, divided

Cooking Instructions

Combine warm milk, yeast, sugar, salt, and melted butter in
the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attached. Add
egg and flour. Drop down dough hook and start kneading on
low speed, stopping and scraping down the sides every so
often in the beginning to make sure all the ingredients are
incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Once everything has come
together, increase speed 1 notch and continue kneading until
dough is very soft, very smooth, and slightly elastic, about
2 minutes. Transfer dough onto a work surface, knead for 1
minute, and shape into a smooth ball. Since the dough has
butter in it, it wonâ€™t be sticky. Return dough ball to a
lightly buttered bowl. Cover, and allow to rise in a warm
spot until it has doubled in size, about 90 minutes. Once
dough is risen, transfer to a work surface and punch down to
de-gas. Shape back into a ball, and weigh on a digital
scale. Divide amount by 8 and weigh out 8 equal dough
portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball, using just
enough flour to keep it from sticking. Press and flatten the
dough into a disc about 3 1/2-inches wide and a 1/2-inch
thick. Shape with your hands to make a small indention in
the middle. Transfer to a silpat-lined baking sheet. Cover
and let proof until almost doubles in size, 45 to 60
minutes. Combine cooled sausage, cream cheese, green onions,
milk, sage, Â½ of the beaten egg, salt, pepper, and cayenne
in a bowl. Mix filling into a thick paste with a spoon.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) Use
slightly damp fingertips to press a well into the center of
each kolache to place the filling. Be sure to leave no more
that 3/4-inch of un-pressed dough around the outside. Do not
press all the way through the dough to the baking sheet.
Brush each kolache with remaining egg wash. Fill evenly with
the sausage cream cheese mixture. Bake in the preheated oven
until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven,
transfer to a wire rack, and allow to rest for 10 to 15
minutes before serving. Top with sliced green onions for
garnish.

Strawberry Lemon Cheesecake Rolls


Ingredients
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 (1/4-ounce) active dry yeast
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 large eggs
1/3 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest, divided
1 3/4 cups strawberry preserves
3/4 cup cheesecake filling
1/3 cup lemon curd
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. In a small saucepan, heat 1 cup of
the milk to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C) over low heat,
about 5 minutes. Pour warm milk into a liquid measuring cup,
and stir in sugar and yeast; let sit until foamy, about 5
minutes. Beat flour, eggs, butter, salt, and 1 teaspoon of
the lemon zest with a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook
attachment on medium speed until crumbly, about 1 minute.
With mixer on low speed, slowly stream in milk mixture until
fully combined, then increase speed to medium-low, and beat
until a smooth dough forms, 8 to 12 minutes. If needed, add
more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough is too sticky.
Transfer dough to a greased 13- x 9-inch baking pan, cover,
and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1
hour. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface;
roll into a 18- x 15-inch rectangle (about 1/4 inch thick).
Spread 1 1/2 cups of the preserves evenly over bottom two-
thirds of the dough starting on 1 long side, leaving a
1/2-inch border. Carefully roll dough into a log starting at
long side with with preserves. Some of the preserves may
spill out as you roll, thatâ€™s okay. Slice dough log into 12
rolls, and arrange, cut sides down, back into greased baking
pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place, until doubled in
size, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden
brown, about 25 minutes. Brush remaining 1/4 cup preserves
evenly over rolls. Let cool slightly at room temperature,
about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together cheesecake
filling, lemon curd, lemon juice, remaining 3 tablespoons
milk, and remaining 1 teaspoon lemon zest in a medium bowl
until combined. Drizzle desired amount of lemon curd mixture
over warm rolls. Serve any remaining lemon curd mixture on
the side.

Thousand Layer Chocolate Brioche


Ingredients
Â¾ cup warm whole milk
1 package active dry yeast
4 Â½ cups all-purpose flour
3 large eggs, beaten
â…“ cup white granulated sugar
1 teaspoon fine salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, very soft
4 tablespoons unsalted butter for laminating dough
Â½ cup dark chocolate chunks
1 large whole egg for brushing
coarse sea salt
white granulated sugar

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Combine warm milk and dry active
yeast in the bowl of your stand mixer; let stand for 10
minutes. Add flour, eggs, sugar, and salt. Use the dough
hook to knead the mixture until the flour almost disappears,
about 1 minute. Add the soft room temperature butter, and
continue kneading the dough until a very smooth ball of
dough forms, 4 to 5 minutes. Set dough into a lightly
buttered bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until
doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours. Punch down the dough and
divide in 2 pieces. Form each half into a smooth ball and
transfer each one into a plastic bag. Refrigerate bags
overnight for best results or the dough can be used
immediately. Each half of the dough will make 4 brioche.
When ready to make, roll and stretch dough into a 14 x 10
inch rectangle. Spread 4 tablespoons of soft room
temperature butter over two thirds of the dough, stopping
1/2 inch from the edge. Fold unbuttered third up over the
top, and then the opposite end to complete the trifold.
Gently press and seal the edges together. Fold in thirds
again to form a square. Wrap and place in the freezer until
cold and slightly firm, about 15 minutes. Roll the dough out
into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick, or thin enough to
fold, and repeat the two folding in thirds step. Wrap and
place in the freezer again until cold and slightly firm, 15
more minutes. A little bit of water can be used to help the
dough stick if needed. Roll dough out into a rectangle
again, just like in the previous step. Fold into thirds, but
keep as a rectangle (do not make the second fold). Wrap and
place in the freezer until cold and slightly firm, about 15
minutes. Roll dough into a 12 x 6 inch rectangle and place
in the freezer until cold and slightly firm, about 15
minutes. Trim off about 1/8 inch of dough from the sides and
cut into 4 rectangles that are about 6 x 3 inches. Start
with 1 piece (keeping the others in the fridge so they stay
cool) and make two cuts starting 1/2 inch from top, all the
way to the bottom to create 3 strips of dough. Braid
together, and seal at bottom. Flip over and add about 1
tablespoon of dark chocolate chunks along the center of the
braided dough, or more to taste. Roll up from the smaller
end to create a knot. Place seam side down in buttered
muffin tin. After all braids are done, cover, and let rise
in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat
the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush brioche
with egg wash, and sprinkle very lightly with some coarse
salt. Then sprinkle very generously with the granulated
sugar. Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until
nicely browned, 20 to 25 minutes. If brioches are getting
too dark, tent with aluminum foil after 15 minutes. Let cool
in the pan for about 5 minutes and then transfer onto a rack
to cool completely before serving. Serve and enjoy!

Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwich


Ingredients
2 slices bacon
4 teaspoons butter, divided
3 large eggs
1 pinch black pepper
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
4 slices bread

Cooking Instructions

Place bacon in a nonstick skillet and cook over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 7
minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Remove bacon to
a drip line tray. Drain off bacon grease for another use.
Wash out the skillet. Whisk eggs with salt and pepper in a
small bowl until frothy. Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the
nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs; let
cook for 30 seconds. Lift the edges of the omelet so that
the uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges and comes into
contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to
move the uncooked egg. Repeat until the top is set, about 3
minutes; reduce heat to low. Meanwhile, chop bacon roughly;
sprinkle over omelet. Sprinkle with cheese; allow cheese to
melt, 1 to 2 minutes. Meanwhile, butter 2 slices of bread
with 1/2 teaspoon butter each. Lay bread, buttered side up,
side-by-side over omelet, leaving about 1 inch between
slices. The melted cheese will help the bread adhere. Run a
spatula around the entire omelet to loosen from the skillet.
Carefully turn the omelet over so buttered side of bread is
in contact with the skillet. Cook until bread is toasted and
golden, about 2 minutes. Using the spatula, fold in edges of
omelet to align with sides of the bread. Cut omelet along
center with the spatula to form 2 sandwiches. Butter 2
remaining bread slices with remaining butter; place butter
side up on each sandwich. Turn sandwiches; cook until
golden, about 2 minutes more. Serve and enjoy immediately!

Chef John’s Tortilla de Patatas


Ingredients
2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or russet potatoes, peeled
1 yellow onion
5 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 cup olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Slice potatoes and onions with a very sharp knife or
mandoline into 1/8-inch thick slices. Combine eggs, 1/2
teaspoon salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl and
whisk very thoroughly; set aside. Add 1/3 cup olive oil to a
large nonstick pan and set heat to medium-high. Add
potatoes, onions, and remaining salt. Cook, tossing and
stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, and some
onions and potatoes are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
Between stirrings, cover potatoes to reduce cooking time and
keep in moisture. For less browning, reduce heat to medium.
Stir potato mixture into egg mixture with a spatula. Cover
and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Add remaining olive oil
to an 8- or 9-inch nonstick pan, and set the pan over
medium-high heat. Pour in egg and potato mixture, and smooth
the top. Cook, covered, for about 4 minutes or until the
bottom is browned and the edges of tortilla begin to firm
up. Slide tortilla out onto a plate, cover with another
plate, and flip the plates over to invert. Slide tortilla
back into the pan, and place back over medium-high heat.
Cook, uncovered, until the tortilla is fully set, about 2
minutes more. Tortilla will spring back lightly when pressed
in the middle with a finger if eggs are fully cooked. If it
feels soft or mushy when pressed, cook for a few minutes
more, unless you prefer the tortilla less than fully set.
Slip tortilla onto a serving plate, and serve hot, warm, or
room temperature.

saucepan, add water and guajillo chiles. Bring mixture to a
boil over high heat, reduce temperature, and simmer until

and add onion, garlic, tomatoes, jalapenos, cumin, and 1
teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion has
softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully
pour mixture into a blender or food processor. Add canned
tomatoes, vinegar, and olive oil. Remove center from the lid
to allow steam to escape and blend until smooth, about 1
minute, scraping down the sides as necessary. In a large
skillet over medium heat, add 1 cup of sauce and bring to a
simmer, stirring often. Add 1/4 of the chips and cook about
3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the chips are well-
coated in sauce and fully heated through. Place chips on a
plate. In a separate small skillet, heat 1/2 tablespoon
butter over medium heat. Crack an egg into the butter and
cook over easy or as desired. Add egg to chips and top with
queso fresco, avocado, crema, and any other desired
toppings.

Crescent Breakfast Squares


Ingredients
2 12x16-inch parchment paper sheets
2 (12 ounce) packages crescent roll dough (such as PillsburyÂ® Grands!â„¢)
8 slices deli ham
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or more to taste
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
Â½ cup diced onion
Â½ cup diced red bell pepper
10 large eggs
1 tablespoon half-and-half cream or heavy whipping cream
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
8 slices Swiss cheese
1 tablespoon bagel seasoning (such as Trader Joe'sÂ® Everything But the Bagel Seasoning Blend)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread each
sheet of parchment on a work surface. Unroll crescent dough,
and place the contents of one can on each sheet. Roll dough
into two 10x15-inch rectangles, making sure the perforations
are sealed, one rectangle per parchment. Slide one dough
rectangle with its parchment paper onto a 13x18-inch sheet
pan; reserve the second rectangle for later use. Working
with the first piece of dough, spread ham slices over the
dough, leaving about 1/2-inch on all sides. Spread Dijon
mustard in a thin layer over the ham slices. Melt 1
tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook
and stir onions and bell peppers until slightly softened,
about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low; add 1 tablespoon
butter to skillet with vegetables until melted. Whisk eggs,
half-and-half or cream, salt, and pepper together in a large
bowl until well blended. Pour egg mixture into the skillet
with vegetables. Cook, using a spatula to lift and move,
until eggs are just set and still wet looking. Spoon lightly
cooked egg mixture in an even layer over the ham slices,
maintaining the 1/2-inch dough border all around. Place
sliced Swiss cheese in a single layer over the eggs. Place
the second dough rectangle over all, using the parchment to
help you align it. Carefully peel off the parchment. Moisten
fingertips and press the edges of the two dough rectangles
together, then use a fork to crimp. Melt remaining 1
tablespoon butter; brush over the top of the dough with a
pastry brush. Sprinkle bagel seasoning over all. Bake in the
preheated oven until nicely browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove to cool on a wire rack for about 15 minutes. Slice
into serving pieces with a sharp knife.

Crêpes Suzette


Ingredients
Â½ cup whole milk
â…“ cup water
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon white sugar
Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt
Â¾ cup all-purpose flour
Â¼ cup unsalted butter, melted, divided
1 teaspoon freshly grated orange zest
â…“ cup fresh orange juice
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
Â¼ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 tablespoon orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier)
Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt
Â¼ cup orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier)
Â½ cup vanilla ice cream, or to taste

Cooking Instructions

To make the crÃªpes: Combine milk, water, eggs, sugar, and
salt in a blender; blend on medium speed until smooth, about
10 seconds. Add flour and blend until smooth, about 5 more
seconds. Add 2 tablespoons of the melted butter and orange
zest; pulse until incorporated, about 3 (1-second) pulses.
Cover blender and place in refrigerator; let rest for 15
minutes. Remove crÃªpe batter from fridge. Heat a 6-inch
nonstick skillet or crÃªpe pan over medium heat. Add 1/2
teaspoon of the melted butter and swirl to coat skillet. Add
2 tablespoons batter and swirl to coat bottom of skillet.
Cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is lightly golden, and
the top is still a little moist, about 1 minute. Swirl
skillet to loosen crÃªpe and gently flip with a spatula and
your fingers. Cook until golden, about 30 seconds. Transfer
to a plate. Repeat with remaining butter and batter. To make
the orange sauce: Combine orange juice, white sugar, and
orange zest in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook,
stirring often, until sugar is dissolved and the liquid
starts to bubble, 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually add butter,
piece by piece, stirring constantly, until it is melted and
fully incorporated. Let sauce come back up to a simmer and
let simmer until slightly syrupy, stirring occasionally,
about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in orange liqueur and salt.
Remove from the heat. Fold each crÃªpe in half, then half
again to make a triangle. Dip the folded crÃªpes into the hot
orange sauce. Place on a serving platter. Repeat with
remaining crÃªpes, overlapping each crÃªpe so they are facing
the same direction. To serve, pour orange liqueur into the
skillet with the remaining orange sauce and place over
medium-high. If it does not ignite automatically, use a
long-stemmed lighter and carefully set the liqueur on fire.
Let it burn for about 30 seconds. Pour the flaming liqueur
over the crÃªpes on the platter and serve immediately with
ice cream.

1 large zucchini, grated and squeezed dry
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
4 large eggs
4 ounces halloumi cheese, sliced

Lemon Cheesecake Creme Brulee Croissants


Ingredients
6 large croissants
1 cup cheesecake filling, such as PhiladelphiaÂ® Cheesecake No-Bak
1/4 cup lemon curd
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water

Cooking Instructions

Combine cheesecake filling, lemon curd and lemon zest in a
bowl; stir well. Add mixture to a piping bag or large zip-
top bag. Make a small cut in the corner of the bag. Use a
paring knife to make a small cut into the side of each
croissant. Create an opening large enough to pipe the
filling into. Fill each roll with about 3 tablespoons of
filling. Place filled croissants on a wire rack set inside a
lined baking sheet to catch excess drippings. Add sugar and
water to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-
high heat. Reduce to medium low and cook, without stirring,
until lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove mixture
from the heat. Working very carefully, pour sugar syrup
evenly over prepared croissants to lightly coat rolls; let
stand until completely cooled and lightly hardened on top,
10 to 15 minutes.

omelets


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Add eggs to a bowl, along with water, soy sauce, mirin,
salt, sugar, and cayenne. Use a fork to beat eggs until
whites are completely incorporated. Transfer egg mixture
into a pourable measuring cup. Set a 10-inch non-stick pan
over medium heat. Mix sesame and vegetable oil in a small
bowl, and use a brush to oil the pan. Pour in 1/3 of egg
mixture. Tilt the pan to cover the bottom with eggs. Cook
until omelet is about halfway set, then use a spatula to
turn over about 1 inch of edge toward the center on 3 sides
to square the shape on those 3 sides. If eggs seem to be
cooking too fast, reduce heat to medium-low. Use a spatula
to roll the omelet toward the rounder side, to form a
rectangular roll, about 2 inches wide by 8 inches long.
Slide omelet over to about 3 inches from the edge of the
pan, and brush more oil over the pan surface. Pour the
second 1/3 of eggs around the omelet. Lift omelet slightly
with the spatula so that some eggs flow underneath. Raise
heat back to medium, if it was reduced. When egg layer is
halfway set, use a spatula to roll this layer up and over
the already-folded omelet in the pan, and continue to roll
into a rectangle. Add remaining 1/3 of egg mixture, and
repeat cooking and rolling steps to make the final layer.
Transfer omelet onto plastic wrap, and use it to shape the
omelet, before wrapping and rolling it into a tight package;
cover with a towel and let rest for 5 minutes. Unwrap, slice
into 6 or 8 pieces, and serve on a warm plate. Sprinkle with
furikake.

Bougatsa


Ingredients
4 large eggs
2/3 cup white sugar
3 cups whole milk
1/2 cup semolina flour
1 cup unsalted butter
2 tablespoons lemon zest
2 tablespoons juice
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup unsalted butter
18 (14x9-inch) frozen phyllo pastry sheets
2 teaspoons confectioner's sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Cooking Instructions

Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Beat eggs with a stand mixer fitted with a
whisk attachment on medium speed until foamy, about 1
minute. Add white sugar; beat on medium speed until thick
and foamy, 4 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat milk in a large
saucepan over medium-low, stirring occasionally, until milk
begins to simmer. With mixer on low speed, slowly pour hot
milk into egg mixture, beating until fully combined, about
30 seconds. Return milk mixture to saucepan. Place saucepan
over medium-low heat, and cook, whisking constantly, until
mixture begins to simmer and thickens slightly, 3 to 4
minutes. Gradually whisk in semolina flour; cook, stirring
constantly, until thickened to a porridge consistency, 1 to
2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Gradually whisk cold
butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, into mixture in saucepan
until emulsified, about 2 minutes. Whisk in lemon zest,
lemon juice, and vanilla. Let custard stand at room
temperature while preparing baking pan, stirring
occasionally. Brush bottom and sides of a nonstick 13- x
9-inch baking pan with about 1 tablespoon of the melted
butter. Gently unfold and place phyllo sheets on a clean
work surface; cover using a damp clean kitchen towel to keep
phyllo moist while you work. Layer 8 phyllo sheets in the
prepared baking pan, lightly brushing each sheet with melted
butter. Spread custard over phyllo in an even layer. Top
with 2 phyllo sheets, lightly brushing each sheet with
melted butter and stretching sheets to cover sides of baking
pan. Working with remaining 8 phyllo sheets, 1 sheet at a
time, place phyllo sheet on work surface; lightly brush with
melted butter. Starting from 1 short end, fold phyllo sheet
accordion-style to create a long strip with 2-inch-wide
pleats. Place folded phyllo strip crosswise in baking pan
with pleats facing up. Repeat brushing and folding process
with remaining 7 phyllo sheets and melted butter, placing
strips side by side to completely cover baking pan. Bake in
the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and crispy,
40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven, and let bougatsa cool
slightly at room temperature for 30 minutes. Dust evenly
with confectioner's sugar and cinnamon. Slice into squares,
and serve warm or at room temperature.

2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Cooking Instructions

For the rhubarb filling: Combine rhubarb and sugar in a
large bowl. Mix to combine and set aside to allow the
rhubarb to release some juice, about 1 hour. For the cake:
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light
and fluffy. Add flour, wine, baking powder, and egg; mix
together to form a dough. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and
place in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
9-inch springform cake pan. Roll dough out on a lightly
floured surface into a circle slightly larger than the
diameter of the cake pan. Transfer to the prepared cake pan,
letting the dough come up the sides by about 1 inch. Drain
rhubarb and evenly scatter over the dough; bake in the
preheated oven for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make the custard
filling: beat almond flour, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons crÃ¨me
fraÃ®che, sugar, eggs, vanilla sugar, and cinnamon together
until smooth. Remove cake from oven after 45 minutes; top
with almond custard mixture and use a spatula to spread it
evenly to the sides of the pan. Return cake to the oven and
bake until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes more. Allow
the cake to cool in the pan before slicing.

Ingredients
3 tablespoons butter
8 brioche-style hamburger buns

5 large eggs
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons whiskey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups milk
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon ketchup
1 teaspoon mustard
1 teaspoon mayonnaise
1/3 cup golden raisins (optional)
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup whiskey
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 pinch salt

Cooking Instructions

Butter a 9x12-inch or 9x13-inch baking dish with 3

a baking sheet. Bake at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) until
very lightly toasted, about 20 minutes. Let cool. For
custard batter, combine eggs, white sugar, whiskey, vanilla,
cinnamon, salt, milk, cream, ketchup, mustard, and
mayonnaise in a bowl; whisk to combine. Lay 6 bun bottoms
into the prepared baking dish. Break last 2 bun bottoms and
1/2 of a top bun into large pieces and use pieces to fill in
the gaps. Ladle half of custard mixture over buns. Place 6
bun tops over bottom layer and use the last 1 1/2 top buns
to fill in the center gap. Ladle remaining custard mixture
over. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or
preferably up to 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Brush the tops of buns with some of the
custard mixture and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake in the
preheated oven until buns are browned and puffed up, about 1
hour. Remove to cool on a wire rack. For whiskey sauce, add
butter, whiskey, brown sugar, water, and a pinch of salt to
a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Turn off heat and let cool before using. Sauce will thicken
as it cools.

Perfect Cheesecake with Strawberry Topping


Ingredients
14 graham crackers
1/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, melted
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs
2 quarts fresh strawberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup water

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Break
graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor. Add sugar
and pulse until large crumbs form. Add butter and pulse just
until combined and mixture resembles slightly wet sand.
Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan; press mixture
lightly into the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of the
pan. Bake in the preheated oven until fragrant and slightly
golden brown around the edges, about 8 minutes. Let cool.
Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil. Place cream cheese
in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using a paddle attachment,
whip cheese on medium speed just until smooth, to avoid
incorporating too much air. Add sugar and beat until smooth,
scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add in sour
cream, vanilla, lemon juice and salt and blend until just
combined. With the mixer on low speed, add eggs, one at a
time, mixing until each egg is fully incorporated, then mix
until just combined and smooth, scraping down the sides of
the bowl as needed. Pour mixture into the prepared crust.
Wrap bottom and sides of pan well with heavy duty aluminum
foil. Place the pan inside a large deep roasting pan and set
pan in the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the
roasting pan around the cheesecake without letting any water
inside the foil wrap or the cheesecake. Bake in the
preheated oven until the center is very slightly jiggly,
about 50 minutes. Carefully remove pans from the oven and
allow cheesecake to cool in the water bath for 15 to 20
minutes. After about 10 minutes, just when cheesecake starts
to release itself from the sides, run a knife around the
sides. Remove wrapped cheesecake from water bath and place
on a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Unwrap
cheesecake and place in refrigerator until fully chilled and
ready to serve, at least 4 hours. Place 1/2 of strawberries
in a large saucepan and stir in sugar, lemon, vanilla,
cornstarch, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat,
stirring often. Reduce heat to medium high and allow mixture
to simmer until berries are softened. Using a potato masher,
mash strawberries until slightly chunky; continue to simmer
until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in
remaining strawberries, and let cool to room temperature.
Refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve cheesecake slices
with strawberry topping.

S'mores Cupcakes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
6 tablespoons brown sugar
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch cinnamon
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon espresso powder
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup brown sugar
1 large egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup sour cream
18 large marshmallows
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
2/3 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon almond extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2
cupcake pans with liners. Prepare the crust: Mix graham
cracker crumbs, melted butter, brown sugar, salt, nutmeg,
and cinnamon together in a small bowl until combined. Place
1 packed tablespoon of crumb mixture into the bottom of
about 18 cupcake liners and press into an even layer. Bake
in the preheated oven until graham cracker crusts are
slightly darker in color, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow crusts to
cool. Prepare cupcakes: Whisk boiling water, cocoa powder,
and espresso powder together In a small bowl or measuring
cup until smooth and combined. Set aside to cool slightly.
Beat butter, vegetable oil, and brown sugar in a large bowl
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3
minutes. Add in egg, vanilla, and salt. Beat for an
additional 3 minutes on medium-high speed. Add in cocoa
powder mixture and beat until thoroughly incorporated. Add
in cake flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and mix until
just combined. Add in sour cream; mix until just combined.
Spoon about 2 heaped tablespoons of cake batter over each
graham cracker crust, making sure to fill each liner no more
than 2/3 full. (There may be extra batter to make 1 or 2
extra cupcakes without a graham cracker crust. Simply put
that batter into an empty liner, filling no more than 2/3
full, and bake as a plain chocolate cupcake). Bake in the
preheated oven, 1 pan at a time, until tops of the cupcakes
spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow
cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before carefully
removing to a wire rack to cool completely. To prepare
frosting, place an oven rack directly below the oven's
broiler; preheat broiler. Line a baking sheet with parchment
paper and lightly grease it. Place large marshmallows about
1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Place pan under broiler
and cook until marshmallows are golden brown and puffy,
rotating the pan often to ensure the tops of the
marshmallows brown evenly without burning, about 1 minute.
Remove pan from oven and allow marshmallows to cool. Place
egg whites, white sugar, cold water, cream of tartar, and
pinch of salt in a very large heatproof mixing bowl. Place
the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water (do not allow
the bottom of the bowl to touch the water), and begin to
beat the mixture on low speed with an electric hand mixer.
Gradually increase speed to medium-high and continue to whip
mixture over hot water until mixture holds stiff peaks, 8 to
10 minutes. Remove from heat and beat for 1 minute more. Add
in toasted marshmallows, vanilla, and almond extract.
Beginning on low speed and gradually increasing the speed to
high, beat mixture until completely smooth and no lumps of
toasted marshmallow remain, and the mixture once again holds
stiff peaks, 5 to 7 minutes. Place mixture into a large
piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Generously pipe
marshmallow frosting onto the top of each cooled cupcake. If
desired, use a kitchen torch to caramelize the frosting
until golden brown.

1 1/2 cups whole milk
5.1 ounce vanilla instant pudding
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup confectionersâ€™ sugar
14 ounce sweetened condensed milk
8 ounce sour cream
1/4 cup salted caramel sauce
1 buttery crackers
6 cups thinly sliced spotted bananas
sea salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Whisk together milk and pudding and
pie filling in a large bowl until mostly smooth. Let stand
until very thick, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, beat vanilla
and 2 1/2 cups of the heavy whipping cream in a large bowl
with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form,
about 2 minutes. Gradually add confectioners' sugar, and
beat until stiff peaks form, 15 to 30 seconds. Whisk
sweetened condensed milk and sour cream into thickened
pudding until smooth. Fold in whipped cream until smooth and
light. Microwave 1/4 cup salted caramel and remaining 2
tablespoons heavy whipping cream in a small microwave-safe
bowl on high until loosened, about 10 seconds; whisk to
combine. Place 32 of the crackers in an even layer in the
bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking up crackers as
needed to fill space. Spread 3 cups of the pudding mixture
in an even layer over crackers. Top pudding mixture with 2
cups of the sliced bananas. Drizzle evenly with about 2
tablespoons of the salted caramel mixture. Repeat layering
process once more, ending with a layer of salted caramel.
Evenly top with remaining 34 crackers, breaking them as
needed to fit. Spread remaining 3 cups pudding mixture over
crackers. Store, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 8
hours or up to overnight. Before serving, top with remaining
2 cups sliced bananas. Drizzle with salted caramel sauce and
sprinkle flaky sea salt. Cut into slices and serve drizzled
with extra caramel sauce if desired.

Strawberries and Cream Cupcakes


Ingredients
2 cups strawberries
6 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 2/3 cups cake flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar
3 large egg whites
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2/3 cup sour cream
1/3 cup 2% milk
2 ounces cream cheese, chilled
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream

Cooking Instructions

Strawberries: Place strawberries and sugar in a small pot
over medium-low heat. Bring mixture to a simmer, stirring
often, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir cornstarch and water
together in a small bowl or measuring cup. Stir cornstarch
mixture into the strawberry mixture, and cook until
thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat, and stir in
lemon zest and lemon juice. Pour mixture into a heat safe
bowl, and place uncovered into the fridge to chill. (Once
mixture is chilled and no longer condensing, you can then
cover the bowl.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Line 2 cupcake pans with liners. Cupcakes: Sift
together cake flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and
nutmeg. Beat butter, oil, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add in egg whites,
vanilla, and almond extract, and beat mixture on medium-high
speed for another 3 minutes. Add in half of flour mixture
and mix until just combined. Add in sour cream and milk; mix
until just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture; mix
until just combined. Pour batter into prepared cupcake pans,
filling each liner no more than 2/3 full. Bake one pan at a
time, until tops of cupcakes spring back when lightly
touched, 22 to 26 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan
for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool
completely, about 30 minutes Chill cupcakes in the
refrigerator for about 1 hour. This will make them easier to
cut and fill. Cream cheese whipped cream: Beat chilled cream
cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt together until
smooth. Add in 1/2 cup cold heavy cream, and mix on low
until mixture is smooth. Add in remaining heavy cream; beat
on medium-high until mixture holds stiff peaks. If desired,
place mixture into a piping bag fitted with an open star tip
(such as a WiltonÂ® 1M). Place piping bag in refrigerator
until ready to use. Remove cupcakes from refrigerator.
Remove the liners and cut tops off cupcakes. Pipe a layer of
whipped cream on bottom half of cupcakes; top with about 1
to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. Place tops of cupcakes
back on, and lightly press down to adhere. Pipe more whipped
cream on top of cupcakes and top with another 1 to 2
teaspoons strawberry mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for
30 minutes before serving.

and vanilla, and whisk until mixture looks homogenous. Add
flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt to butter
mixture; whisk until almost fully incorporated and a few dry
streaks remain, about 1 minute. Fold freeze-dried
strawberries into flour mixture until fully combined and
strawberries are broken up into smaller bits. Scoop dough
into 16 portions (about 3 tablespoons each). Working with 1
dough portion at a time, use your hands to flatten dough
into a 1/2-inch thick disk. Place a frozen cream cheese ball
in center of dough disk, and carefully wrap dough around
cream cheese ball to enclose. Transfer cookie to prepared
baking sheet. Repeat procedure with remaining dough and
cream cheese balls. Chill cookies, uncovered, 30 minutes.
Line a second large rimmed baking sheet with parchment
paper. Transfer 8 of the cookies to the second sheet,
spacing all cookies about 1 inch apart. Bake in preheated
oven until edges are golden and the tops are set, about 12
minutes, rotating baking sheets between top and bottom racks
halfway through bake time. Let cookies cool on the baking
sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack and
cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.

Strawberry Oreo Cheesecake


Ingredients
2 cups fresh strawberries
6 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 1/4 cups OreoÂ® cookies
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
16 small strawberries
4 OreoÂ® cookies
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
1 pinch ground nutmeg
3 large eggs

Cooking Instructions

Strawberry sauce: Place strawberries, sugar, lemon juice,
and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook,
stirring often, until strawberries soften and release their
juices, about 10 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash
strawberries. Stir water and cornstarch together in a small
bowl. Add cornstarch mixture to strawberries, and cook,
stirring constantly, until mixture begins to thicken, 1 to 2
minutes more. Remove from heat, and carefully pour mixture
through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl; use the back of a
wooden spoon or spatula to press out as much juice as
possible. Discard pulp. Place strawberry sauce, uncovered,
into the refrigerator to cool. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom of a
9-inch springform pan. Oreo crust: Combine cookie crumbs,
brown sugar, and salt. Stir in melted butter until
thoroughly combined. Press mixture evenly into the bottom
and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Place pan on a
rimmed baking sheet. Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15
minutes. Remove from the oven, leaving oven on, and allow to
cool for 10 minutes. Cheesecake filling: Beat cream cheese
and sugar until thoroughly smooth and combined. Add in heavy
cream, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, almond extract,
and nutmeg; beat on low speed until smooth. Add in eggs, and
beat on low speed just until eggs are incorporated. Pour
half of filling into crust. Drizzle 6 tablespoons of cooled
strawberry sauce over filling. Pour remaining filling into
the pan, taking care to cover strawberry sauce. Reserve
remaining strawberry sauce, covered, in the refrigerator
until ready to serve the cheesecake. Return cheesecake to
the oven and bake until the top looks set, and edges are
beginning to turn golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Turn oven
off, prop the door slightly ajar, and leave cheesecake to
cool in the oven for 1 hour. Remove cheesecake to a wire
rack. Run a knife around the top edge of cheesecake to
loosen it slightly from the pan; allow to cool in the pan to
room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8
hours. When ready to serve, toss halved strawberries into
reserved strawberry sauce until thoroughly coated. Remove
cheesecake from springform pan; place on a serving platter.
Pour strawberries and sauce on top of the cake, and turn all
the berries cut-side-down. Garnish with halved Oreos, if
desired. Keep extra cheesecake stored in the fridge.

Tartufo


Ingredients
1 quart vanilla ice cream (such as Haagen Dazs
8 maraschino cherries (such as Luxardo
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
5 tablespoons coconut oil
36 chocolate wafer cookies chocolate wafer cookies
1/2 cup roasted pistachios (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Let ice cream stand at room
temperature until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Line
8 small bowls with plastic wrap, leaving a 3-inch overhang.
Using a 2 oz. (1/4-cup) ice-cream scoop, place 1 scoop of
ice cream into the bottom of each bowl. Gently press a
maraschino cherry into the top of each ice-cream scoop, then
top each with another 2 oz. (1/4-cup) scoop of ice cream.
Working with 1 bowl of ice cream at a time, gather
overhanging plastic, wrap it up around ice cream, and gently
twist it to form a ball. Freeze until ice cream is firm and
set, about 2 hours. Place chocolate chips in a large
microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on HIGH in (30-second)
intervals, stirring thoroughly between intervals, until
melted, 3 to 4 minutes total. Whisk in coconut oil until oil
is completely melted and mixture is combined. Let cool
slightly at room temperature, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
pulse cookies and pistachios, if using, in a food processor
until finely ground, about 15 quick pulses. Transfer to a
shallow bowl, and set aside at room temperature. Working
with 1 ice-cream ball at a time, remove ice-cream ball from
freezer. Remove plastic wrap, and place ice-cream ball on a
wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Pour chocolate
mixture over ice-cream ball, allowing it to thinly coat the
top and sides. If coating in cookie mixture, quickly and
carefully invert chocolate-coated ice-cream ball into cookie
mixture, rolling until evenly coated. Transfer coated ice
cream ball to a clean wire rack set inside a large, rimmed
baking sheet in the freezer. Repeat process with remaining 7
ice-cream balls, returning to the freezer after each one.
Freeze until set, about 1 hour, or until ready to serve.

These Copycat Choco Tacos Taste Just Like the Real Thing


Ingredients
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup egg whites
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup water
vanilla fudge swirl ice cream
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup unsalted peanuts

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Stand a thin hard cover book up
straight with the hard edge facing upwards. Drape a sheet of
parchment across the book (this is what you will use to
shape the shells). Line a plate with parchment paper. Heat
butter in a small saucepan over medium-low until melted, 2
to 3 minutes. Transfer the melted butter to a bowl, then
whisk in brown sugar, egg whites, vanilla to taste, and 1/2
teaspoon salt. Add flour and water. Whisk until the batter
is smooth and no clumps remain. Heat a non-stick skillet
over medium. Pour about 1 tablespoon batter into the pan;
spread into a thin layer with a spoon. Cook until browned on
the bottom and bubbles begin to form on top, 1 to 2 minutes.
Flip and cook until browned on other side, 1 to 2 minutes
more. Remove from pan and immediately drape over parchment-
lined book, pressing to help form that taco shell shape.
Transfer to a parchment-lined plate and repeat with
remaining batter. Let cool completely before filling.
Alternatively, preheat a waffle cone maker according to
manufacturer's instructions. Pour batter into the preheated
waffle maker and cook according to instructions. Remove from
pan and immediately drape across the parchment-lined book.
Let cool completely before filling. Remove ice cream from
the freezer and let soften for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile,
combine chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe
bowl; microwave in 30-second intervals, mixing well between
each, until mixture is melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in chopped peanuts. Carefully fill the taco shells with
the ice cream, pressing down gently to evenly distribute the
ice cream to the edges. Repeat with the remaining taco
shells. Place back on the parchment-lined plate. Dip the top
of each ice cream taco in the peanut-chocolate mixture to
completely coat the exposed ice cream. Return to the
parchment-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining tacos until
all are dipped. Once chocolate has hardened, carefully place
Choco Tacos in a sealable container or bag and return to
freezer.

Vanilla Crème Brûlée


Ingredients
3 large egg yolks
Â¼ cup superfine sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla bean paste
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon superfine sugar

Cooking Instructions

Place egg yolks in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer on
high speed until eggs are thick and light yellow, about 5
minutes. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup sugar and vanilla bean
paste. Pour cream into the top of a double boiler over
simmering water and simmer until just hot to the touch,
about 3 minutes. Pour 1/2 of the warmed cream into the egg
mixture, a little at a time, whisking constantly so eggs do
not curdle. Pour egg yolk-cream mixture into the remaining
cream in the double boiler. Cook over medium heat, stirring
continuously, until mixture thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Do
not let mixture boil. Pour custard into 4 small ramekins and
refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours, up to 24 hours.
Sprinkle each crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e with some of the remaining
tablespoon of superfine sugar. Use a blowtorch to melt the
sugar on top of the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. It will crystallize as it
hardens. Alternatively you can use the oven broiler, but be
careful to not burn the sugar. Lightly tap the crystallized
sugar with the back of a spoon to break it before eating.

beginning to simmer. Remove from heat, and stir in yogurt
until completely smooth and combined. Let mixture cool to
room temperature. Beat cream and vanilla together In a large
bowl until cream holds stiff peaks. Stir 1/4 of whipped
cream into cooled berry mixture, then fold berry mixture

peanut butter in a large saucepan over low heat and stir

combined. Stir in the crispy rice cereal until thoroughly
coated and spread over the marshmallow creme layer, pressing

minutes. Cut into bars to serve.
