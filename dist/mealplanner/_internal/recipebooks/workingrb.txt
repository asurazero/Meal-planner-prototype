Bacon Stuffed French Toast Sliders


Ingredients
1 pound bacon
1 (12 count) package Hawaiian rolls
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
2 large eggs
1/3 cup half-and-half
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon maple syrup
confectioner's sugar, for serving (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a
baking sheet with aluminum foil, and lay bacon strips in a
single layer on the sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until
browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. Drain bacon slices on
paper towels. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F
(160 degrees C). Slice rolls in half lengthwise. Spread 2
tablespoons butter over the cut side of bottom half of
rolls. Top evenly with brown sugar and cayenne pepper.
Arrange bacon slices over brown sugar mixture. Spread 1
tablespoon butter evenly into the bottom of a 9x13-inch
casserole dish. Place the prepared sandwich half in the
buttered pan. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, vanilla, salt, and
syrup together in a separate 9x13-inch baking dish. Add top
half of rolls to egg mixture and turn a couple times to coat
and lightly soak the bread. Allow the excess egg mixture to
drip off and place top half of rolls over bacon layer. Cover
with foil. Discard any excess egg mixture. Bake in the
preheated oven for 15 minutes. Uncover and bake until golden
brown and lightly toasted, 5 to 10 minutes more. Spread
remaining butter over the tops. Cut into 12 servings. Dust
with confectioner's sugar. Serve with syrup for dipping.

Balsamic Braised Pork Tenderloins with Fresh Figs


Ingredients
2 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloins
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 shallots, thinly sliced lengthwise
12 fresh figs, stemmed and halved
1 cup chicken broth
Â¼ cup good-quality balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
fresh rosemary sprigs for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pat
tenderloins dry and remove silver skin, if present. Season
with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste. Pour
oil into a large, oven-proof skillet and heat over medium-
heat until oil shimmers. Carefully place seasoned
tenderloins into the hot oil and brown on all sides, 7 to 10
minutes total. Add sliced shallots around tenderloins and
stir, about 1 minute. Add figs, chicken broth, and balsamic
vinegar. When the mixture begins to bubble, sprinkle minced
rosemary over everthing. Cover, place in the preheated oven
and bake until pork is no longer pink in the center, 25 to
30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Using
tongs, remove pork from the skillet and place on a serving
platter. With a slotted spoon, remove figs from the skillet
and place around the tenderloins. Cover loosely with foil.
Place skillet back onto the stovetop over medium-high heat.
Bring pan juices to a boil and allow to reduce to about 3/4
cup, 10 to 15 minutes. Slice tenderloins, drizzle reduced
liquid over the meat, and garnish with fresh rosemary
sprigs, if desired.

very finely chopped. Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix
in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat,
and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and set aside. Combine water and beef
bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring
to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes
dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.
Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper
sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes,
and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix
in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.
Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet
over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15
minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the
simmering gumbo. Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire
sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more
minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just
before serving. Serve hot and enjoy!

Roasted Pork Chops with Zucchini


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup rated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning blend
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 large egg
4 zucchini, quartered lengthwise, then halved crosswise
4 boneless pork chops
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
16 cherry tomatoes (optional)
4 parsley sprigs, or as needed (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and line
a 12x18-inch sheet pan with foil. Place a baking rack on top
of the foil. In a small bowl, combine panko bread crumbs,
Parmesan cheese, Italian herb seasoning, red pepper flakes,
granulated garlic, smoked paprika, and salt and pepper to
taste. Place 2/3 of the mixture on a plate, and set aside.
Break egg into a shallow bowl and beat until the white and
yolk are incorporated. Lightly brush each zucchini piece
with egg, and toss with 1/3 of the panko crumb mixture.
Place breaded zucchini on the prepared rack. Dip chops into
beaten egg and hold over the bowl to allow excess to drip
back into the bowl. Place each chop on the reserved panko
mixture, then turn and coat the other side with panko
mixture, gently patting mixture onto each chop. Heat olive
oil and butter together in a large skillet over medium heat
until butter is melted and no longer sizzling. Carefully
place each chop into the skillet and brown each side,
turning once, 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning once. Nestle
browned chops on the prepared rack with zucchini pieces.
Roast in the preheated oven until chops are no longer pink
at the center and zucchini is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. An
instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chops
should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove chops from
the oven and place on a serving plate. If desired, broil
zucchini pieces until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. See
Cookâ€™s Note. Garnish with cherry tomatoes and fresh parsley,

Ronto Wrap


Ingredients
1 pound pork tenderloin,
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 garlic clove
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
pinch cayenne
pinch of cumin
kosher salt
4 pork sausages
1 12 ounce) coleslaw mix
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon jalapeno pepper
1 lime, juiced
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon osher salt
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup reek yogurt
1 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon orcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons peppercorns
Kosher salt to taste
4 pita or naan, warmed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the
trimmed pork tenderloin on a plate or work surface. Combine
olive oil, grated garlic, red pepper flakes, cayenne, and
cumin in a small bowl. Rub the oil and spice mixture all
over the pork, coating the entire surface, then season
generously with Kosher salt. Preheat a coated cast-iron
skillet over medium-high heat, about 2 minutes. Add pork
tenderloin and cook until deeply golden brown, about 5
minutes. Flip tenderloin over and cook for an additional 3
minutes. Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and roast
for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, push tenderloin to one
side of the skillet and add the sausages. Roast for an
additional 10 minutes, flipping sausages halfway through,
until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145
degrees F (62 degrees C). Remove skillet from the oven and
tent with foil to rest for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
combine coleslaw mix, cilantro, apple cider vinegar,
jalapeÃ±o, lime juice, freshly ground black pepper, and salt
in a bowl. Use tongs to toss the slaw so everything is
evenly mixed. Combine mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, lemon juice,
horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and kosher salt
in a small bowl for the peppercorn sauce. Taste and adjust
the seasoning according to your tastes. When ready to
assemble, wrap the pita or naan in foil and place in the
oven while you carve the pork to warm slightly. The oven
does not need to be on, the residual heat from roasting the
pork will be enough to warm the bread. Split the sausages
down the center lengthwise. Carve the pork tenderloin into
1/4-inch thick slices. To assemble, place a warm piece of
pita or naan on a large plate. Set down 4 to 5 slices of
pork tenderloin, and add a sausage on top. place about 1
loosely packed cup of the prepared slaw on top, then drizzle
without about 2 tablespoons of peppercorn sauce. Roll the
wrap up and enjoy.

3 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon sliced garlic
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
6 cups 1/2-inch x 2-inch rainbow carrot sticks
4 cups 1/2-inch x 2-inch peeled, seeded butternut squash chunks
Â½ red onion, sliced lengthwise
2 (1 1/4 pound) pork tenderloins

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a
sheet pan with parchment paper or foil. Place 2 tablespoons
olive oil, dates, vinegar, rosemary, garlic, salt, and
pepper in a blender or small food processor. Pulse several
times to mix, then puree until smooth, about 1 minute.
Reserve 2 tablespoons of the mixture for later use. Combine
rainbow carrots, butternut squash, and red onion in a large
bowl. Toss with balsamic mixture, and place on the prepared
sheet pan. Roast vegetables, uncovered in the preheated oven
for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, blot tenderloins with paper
towels. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over
medium-high heat. Place tenderloins in skillet and cook
until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Stir
vegetables; nestle tenderloins into vegetables. Brush each
tenderloin with 1 tablespoon reserved balsamic mixture and
return the sheet pan to the oven. Roast, uncovered, until
vegetables are tender and pork is slightly pink in the
center, about 20 minutes. The internal temperature of the
meat should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Drizzle vegetables and tenderloins with remaining 1
tablespoon olive oil.

Skillet Pork Chops with Mushroom Gravy


Ingredients
4 pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
1 onion, sliced
2 cups mushrooms
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup white wine
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, or to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
fresh thyme sprigs for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Blot chops dry with paper towels and season both sides with
salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1
tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-
high heat. When butter sizzles, add chops and brown on both
sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chops from the
skillet and keep warm. To the same skillet, add remaining
olive oil and butter. When butter is melted, add onions,
mushrooms, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring, until
onions begin to turn translucent and mushrooms are softened,
4 to 5 minutes. Stir in minced garlic and cook until
fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chicken stock, wine, and
dried thyme, and bring to a boil. Return chops and any
accumulated juices to the skillet, nestling chops down into
vegetables and broth. Remove about 1/4 cup of broth for
later use. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until an
instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 145
degrees F (63 degrees C), 4 to 5 minutes. See note. Stir
cornstarch into the reserved cooking liquid, and stir until
there are no lumps. While stirring the skillet sauce, add
cornstarch mixture, and continue stirring 3 to 4 minutes, or
until the sauce thickens. Serve chops with mushrooms and
sauce on top, and garnish with fresh thyme sprigs, if
desired.

Sous Vide Maple Chipotle BBQ Pork Chops


Ingredients
1 cup ketchup
Â¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
Â¼ cup apple cider vinegar
Â¼ cup maple syrup
1 large jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon chopped canned chipotle chiles in adobo
1 tablespoon adobo sauce from canned chipotle chiles
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 Â½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1 teaspoon chili powder
Â½ teaspoon onion powder
Â½ teaspoon garlic powder
Â½ teaspoon smoked paprika
4 (1 1/4-inch-thick) bone-in, center cut pork chops
Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Prepare a thermocirculator and water bath according to
manufacturer's directions. Set thermocirculator to 135
degrees F(57 degrees C) (if you want the pork cooked medium
instead of medium-rare, set to 145 degrees F (62 degrees
C)), and allow water bath to come up to temperature. Stir
together ketchup, melted butter, vinegar, maple syrup,
jalapeno, mustard, chipotles, adobo sauce, Worcestershire, 1
teaspoon salt, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder,
and smoked paprika for the sauce in a bowl. You should have
about 2 cups sauce. Season all chops evenly with remaining 1
1/2 teaspoons salt and pepper and place chops in an even
layer in a large vacuum sealable bag. Pour 1 cup of the
sauce into bag. Cover and chill remaining sauce. Massage bag
to be sure each chop is evenly coated in sauce, then seal
bag with a vacuum sealer according to manufacturer's
directions. Transfer vacuum-sealed chops to warm water bath
with thermocirculator, cover vessel with aluminum foil to
reduce evaporation. Cook 40 minutes (meat will be 135
degrees F to 145 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees C) when done
depending on desired doneness). Remove bag from water bath
and transfer meat from bag onto a rimmed baking sheet and
drizzle with canola oil. Preheat a grill or a grill pan to
medium-high (400 degrees F to 450 degrees F (200 degrees C
to 230 degrees C)). Grill meat, uncovered, until grill marks
appear, basting with 1/2 cup of the reserved sauce, 1 to 2
minutes per side. Serve chops with remaining 1/2 cup sauce
and a sprinkle of cilantro.

chicken fried steak


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Trim fat caps off steaks. Rub steaks with salt, then
Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. Let rest for 30 minutes.
Transfer one steak to a cutting board and cover with plastic
wrap. Use a meat mallet to pound the steak until it is about
half the original thickness and twice the original area.
Repeat with remaining two steaks. Place 2 cups flour in a
shallow bowl. Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and hot sauce together
in a second bowl. Combine remaining 3 cups flour, bread
crumbs, baking powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, onion
powder, Cajun seasoning, sea salt, chile seasoning, black
pepper, thyme, oregano, sweet paprika, chipotle powder,
cumin, sage, mustard powder, and cayenne pepper in a third,
large bowl. Dunk each piece of steak in the plain flour,
then in the egg wash, and then in the breading, making sure
it gets completely coated in each step. Transfer to a plate
and refrigerate for 1 hour; this is crucial and ensures the
breading will adhere to the meat. When ready to cook,
prepare gravy: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like
and light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Gradually whisk
beef broth into the flour mixture, then gradually whisk in
cream, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat
to low and cook, stirring occasionally, to let it further
thicken. Keep warm as you cook the steaks. Heat oil in a
deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
C). Drop steaks into the hot oil and fry until breading is
crisp and golden brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper
towel-lined plate to drain. Serve hot steaks with gravy.

salisbury steak


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a
large casserole dish with cooking spray. Lightly mix ground
beef, 1/2 cup onion, bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons beef broth,
milk, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl;
divide into 5 portions and shape into patties. Season flour
with salt and pepper in a wide, shallow dish. Gently lay
patties into the flour to lightly coat. Heat vegetable oil
in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Fry patties in
hot oil until browned completely, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
Remove patties to a plate lined with paper towels to drain
excess grease. Stir remaining beef broth, cream of mushroom
soup, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl
until smooth. Arrange drained patties into the prepared
casserole dish. Spread onion slices atop the patties and
pour the soup mixture over the patties to cover completely.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the
center, 45 minutes to 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F
(70 degrees C).

Air Fryer Smashed Potatoes


Ingredients
8 ounces baby gold potatoes
1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Meanwhile, place potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl: cook on
high until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer potatoes
to a baking sheet and use the bottom of a small glass to

you flatten the potatoes, the crispier they will be. Brush
melted butter over the tops of smashed potatoes. Season with
salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Place potatoes in the
basket of the air fryer in an even layer; cook until golden
and crisp, about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve
hot.

Big Fat Fondant Potatoes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon miso paste
1 1/2 teaspoons dashi powder
6 large russet potatoes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2/3 cup chicken broth

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring
chicken broth to a simmer; whisk in miso and dashi. Turn off
the heat; set aside until needed. Turn potatoes onto
narrowest side; trim straight down to create a flat surface.
Turn and trim the other side with a straight cut parallel to
the first. Cut a little off each end to square the potato a
bit more, then make 2 angled cuts on each side of the
squared ends. Transfer to a bowl of cold water. Reserve
trimmings for another use. Drain, and dry with paper towels.
Place a large cast-iron pan or other heavy ovenproof skillet
on high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil; place potatoes in
skillet with largest flat side down. Season tops with half
the salt. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook until well
browned, about 4 minutes. Turn potatoes over and repeat, to
salt and brown the other side, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat
to medium, and use a paper towel to soak up excess oil
between potatoes in the pan. Add butter, and as it melts,
baste tops of potatoes with melted butter. Once butter has
toasted to a light brown color, turn off the heat and strain
in the miso dashi broth. Roast potatoes, uncovered, in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Remove and turn
potatoes over. Add the 2/3 cup plain chicken broth, and
return to the oven to continue roasting at 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C) until potatoes can be pierced very easily
with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes more. Check occasionally to
see if broth has evaporated; add more as needed. Brush tops
of potatoes with pan drippings, and serve.

Easy Fermented Pickled Veggies


Ingredients
3 cups water
3 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 pound VEGETABLES)
1 bunch HERBS)
2 teaspoons peppercorns
3 cloves garlic,

Cooking Instructions

To sanitize jar, put a 1-quart wide-mouthed canning jar in a
6- to 8-quart pot; cover with tap water. (You could also use
multiple smaller wide-mouthed canning jars.) Bring to a
boil; boil 10 minutes. Using tongs, carefully remove jar
from pot, draining excess water; let jar cool slightly.
Meanwhile, for brine, stir together filtered water and salt
in a 1-quart measuring cup until salt is dissolved. Add
radishes (or other VEGETABLES), mint (or other HERBS),
peppercorns (or other KICK), and garlic to jar. Veggies can
be packed tightly; they will shrink and soften as they
pickle. Fill jar with brine; you may have brine left over.
Add a fermenting weight or an inverted, sanitized plastic
lid to keep vegetables submerged. Cover jar with a kitchen
towel, securing with a rubber band. Let stand at room
temperature for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days. Youâ€™ll
start to see bubbles forming. The vegetables will become
more tart and the brine will become cloudier the longer the
pickles stand. Remove fermenting weight and screw on metal
lid. Chill up to 3 weeks.

1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 tablespoon fresh ginger
1 1/4 teaspoons ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups basmati rice or other long grain white rice
3 cups water
1/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/3 cup sliced green onions (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Melt butter in a pan or pot with a tight-fitting lid over

whisking, for 1 minute. Add rice, and stir until every grain
is coated with butter. Stir in water, and bring to a boil
over high heat. As soon as it begins to boil, gently shake

Green Goddess Pasta Salad Is the Only Thing We’re Bringing to Potlucks


Ingredients
16 ounces pasta
1 cup frozen peas
12 spears asparagus
2 green onions
1/2 cup feta
fresh herbs
1 cup baby spinach
1 cup fresh basil
1 chives
1 small shallot
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 cup raw cashews
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 lemons
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Bring a pot of heavily salted water to a boil over medium-
high heat. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook
according to package instructions, or until the pasta is al
dente. Drain the pasta. Transfer the pasta to a large bowl
to allow to cool. Meanwhile, combine spinach, basil, chives,
shallot, garlic, cashews, Parmesan cheese, nutritional
yeast, vinegar, and lemon juice in the container of a
blender. Pulse to start blending. Add olive oil in a stream
to emulsify to desired consistency. Season with salt and
pepper. Set aside. Steam peas and asparagus until they
slightly soften and become bright green, 2 to 3 minutes.
(You can opt to blanch your vegetables here as well, or
simply microwave with a little water for the same amount of
time.) Remove from heat, rinse with cold water, drain, and
transfer on top of the pasta along with the green onions.
Add the dressing over the pasta and vegetables and toss
gently to combine. You may or may not use all of it
depending on how coated you like the pasta. Add feta and
herbs, and taste for seasoning. Enjoy immediately or
refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.

Million Dollar Potato Salad


Ingredients
4 large eggs
3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes
1/2 cup dill pickle brine, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
6 slices bacon
1/3 cup chives
1/4 cup dill pickles
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/3 cup crispy fried onions

Cooking Instructions

Gather your ingredients. Place eggs into a small pot and
cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then
remove from the heat and cover with a lid. Let sit for 10
minutes. Drain eggs and place into an ice bath to cool
completely. Peel eggs and cut into quarters, or smaller if
you prefer. Peel potatoes and cut into roughly 2-inch
chunks. Add potatoes to a large pot of cold water, season
the water generously with salt, and add 1/4 cup pickle juice
(this helps them to hold together once cooked - you can
alternatively use 2 tablespoons white vinegar). Bring to a
boil over a high heat, reduce the heat, and simmer until
potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes and
set aside. Meanwhile, make dressing: Stir Parmesan,
mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, and remaining 1/4 cup dill
pickle brine together in a bowl. Pour the dressing over the
hot potatoes and stir to coat. Taste and season with salt,
if needed, then leave to cool. Place bacon into a large
skillet and fry over medium heat, turning over to let both
sides crisp up, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove to a chopping board
and cut into bite-sized pieces. To the cooled potatoes, add
the boiled eggs, celery, chopped dill pickle, most of the
bacon and most of the chives. Mix together to combine. When
ready to serve, transfer the potato salad to a serving dish
and garnish with remaining chives and bacon, as well as the
crispy fried onions.

Ingredients
3 ounces Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon italian seasoning
2 teaspoons garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
2 pounds head cabbage

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230
degrees C) with racks in top third and lower third
positions. Line 2 large-rimmed baking sheets with parchment
paper. Stir together Parmesan cheese, oil, Italian

until cheese is well coated in oil mixture. Evenly spread
Parmesan mixture on one side of each cabbage wedge (about 2
tablespoons per wedge) and arrange, paste side down, on the
prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until
cabbage is tender-crisp and Parmesan creates a golden brown
crust on bottom of cabbage, 16 to 18 minutes, rotating pans
between top and bottom racks and from front to back halfway
through. Remove cabbage from oven, and let stand undisturbed
for 2 minutes, before using a spatula to release cabbage
wedges from baking sheets. Turn cabbage wedges over, cheese
side up; and bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) until
cabbage is tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve hot.

2 cups flour
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 green onions, thinly sliced
chopped parsley for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine water, milk, butter, and salt in a large saucepan
and bring just to a boil. Whisk in grits until incorporated.
Reduce heat to simmer, cover, and cook until thick, 25 to 30
minutes, stirring often. If mixture gets too thick, add a
little more milk or water. Cut kernels off corn cobs, and
using the back of the knife, carefully scrape the cob to
release the creamy corn milk. Stir corn kernels and corn
milk into grits and continue cooking until grits are creamy
and tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer, stirring often. Stir in
pepper and adjust seasonings if necessary. Meanwhile, heat a
large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add olive
oil and bacon slices in a single layer, and cook until bacon
is crisp, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Remove
bacon from the skillet, drain on paper towels, and set
aside. Crumble bacon once cool enough to handle. Reserve
drippings in the skillet and return skillet to medium-high
heat. Finely slice green onions and reserve green ends for
garnish. Add white parts of green onion, onion, green and
red bell peppers, and okra to the skillet and cook until
softened and lightly browned, stirring often, about 5
minutes. Add in salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne and
cook for 1 minute. Add fresh tomatoes and garlic, and cook
for 2 minutes. Add butter to mixture and allow it to melt.
Sprinkle flour over skillet and cook, stirring constantly,
about 1 minute. Add in tomatoes, with juices, and stock
while stirring constantly until smooth. Stir in sugar,
Worcestershire, and hot sauce, and return mixture to a
simmer. Cook gravy for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Heat peanut oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large,
deep skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs in a bowl;
add shrimp and stir to coat. In a shallow dish, whisk flour,
salt, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Working a
few at a time, remove shrimp from egg, allowing excess to
drip off, and lightly coat in flour mixture. Transfer shrimp
to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with
remaining shrimp. Working in batches, add shrimp to hot oil
and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned and
crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on a wire rack set over a paper
towel-lined baking sheet. To serve, place grits in the
bottom of a shallow bowl. Top with about 1/2 cup of gravy
and 6 to 8 shrimp. Top with crumbled bacon, and sprinkle
with green onions and parsley if desired.

Ingredients
1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons ginger
3 tablespoons Korean chili flakes
2 teaspoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
3 tablespoons rice vinegar

alfredo sauce pasta


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Soak cashews in 1 1/2 cups water in a bowl until softened,
at least 20 minutes. Drain water; add almond milk. Blend
mixture in an electric blender or food processor until
smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup water, or as
needed, until sauce is slightly thinner than you want it for
the final product, as it thickens when heated. Add garlic,
nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; blend
until smooth. Pour mixture into a saucepan. Heat on medium-
low heat, stirring occasionally until heated through and
desired thickness is achieved, about 5 minutes. You can add
additional water or almond milk if sauce becomes too thick.

Air Fryer Cinnamon Roll Bites


Ingredients
1 (12.4 ounce) cinnamon rolls
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon orange peel
1 tablespoon orange juice
icing

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)
according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Add sugar and
cinnamon to a large resealable plastic bag, and shake to
combine. Remove the 8 cinnamon rolls from the can, and set

batches, and your timing may vary, so watch closely.
Meanwhile, prepare the dip. Add cream cheese, confectionerâ€™s
sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and the packaged icing to
a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed
until you reach a dipping consistency, about 1 minute. Drop
the warm pieces into the sugar-cinnamon mixture, and shake.
Transfer to a plate or basket, and serve with the dip.

Banana Bread Brownies


Ingredients
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 ounces dark chocolate, broken into pieces
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 large egg
2 bananas, mashed (about 1 cup)
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
12 slices banana (optional)
2 tablespoons white sugar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Generously butter a 9x9-inch square pan. A piece of
parchment paper can also be added to the bottom of the pan
to prevent sticking. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Melt chocolate
in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second
intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an
electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg, vanilla, and
mashed banana, and beat until combined. Add chocolate, and
beat until mixture is well combined and smooth. Use a
spatula to mix in walnuts and chocolate chips, then use the
spatula to mix in flour just until flour disappears.
Transfer batter into the prepared pan and smooth top. Place
banana slices on top, evenly spaced in a grid pattern. Bake
in the preheated oven until a skewer comes out almost clean
but with some batter on the very tip. If you want fudgier
brownies, do not overcook. Let brownies cool in the pan.
Cover, refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour, and serve
chilled. For optional banana brÃ»lÃ©e: While brownies are
cooling, cover each banana slice with a half teaspoon of
sugar. Use a propane kitchen torch to melt the sugar until
dark brown and bubbling. Be careful not to char the edges of
the crust around the banana too much. This banana brÃ»lÃ©e
step can also be done before the brownies go into the oven.

Cheese and Potato Stuffed Flatbread


Ingredients
2 russet potatoes
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon melted butter
2 tablespoons green onions (optional)
2 tablespoons green chilies (optional)
4 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into very small cubes
1 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese
3 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter, divided
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon hot chili pepper flakes
1 tablespoon green onions (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place
potatoes in a baking dish, and pierce skins several times
with a knife. Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until very
tender when tested with a knife, about 1 hour. Remove from
the oven, cover with a towel, and cool potatoes to room
temperature, about 30 minutes. Turn oven off. Place flour in
a bowl, and make a small well in the center with a fork.
Pour milk, water, and salt into the well, and stir with a
fork to form a shaggy dough. Pour in the 1 tablespoon melted
butter, and continue to mix with a fork until dough begins
to come together. Lightly flour your hand and knead in the
bowl until the sides of the bowl are clean, and dough forms
into a ball. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work
surface and knead until dough is smooth and slightly
elastic, 2 to 4 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and set
aside to rest for 15 to 30 minutes. Measure out 8 ounces of
cooled, cooked potato; add to a bowl and mash with the back
of a fork, until slightly chunky or completely smooth, as
desired. Add green onions, green chilies, mozzarella,
Cheddar, and feta cheese and stir thoroughly to combine.
Season with salt and pepper. Mash filling into a compact
disc, about 5 inches in diameter, in the bottom of the bowl.
Turn filling out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap tightly,
give filling a final shaping, and place in the refrigerator
until ready to use. Roll dough out on a well-floured work
surface into a 10- to 11-inch circle. Place chilled filling
disc in center of dough circle. Working around the circle,
fold dough up toward the center to cover filling completely,
pleating dough as needed and using a moistened finger to
stick dough together where it overlaps. Flour the top, and
flip over so the seam side is down. Again, flour the top of
filled dough, and roll gently into an even circle, 3/4- to
1-inch thick. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick
skillet over medium heat. Gently place filled bread in the
skillet and cook, covered, until the bottom is a light
golden brown, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip over, and
cook, covered, until the other side is golden, about 5
minutes. Turn bread back over, and brush top and sides with
remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter. Cook for 1 to 2
minutes more. If flatbread begins to bulge, poke a small
hole with a knife to release steam. Transfer to a cutting
board and cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stir honey
and pepper flakes together in a small bowl. Sprinkle
flatbread with green onions, cut into wedges, and serve with
spicy honey.

Copycat Texas Roadhouse Rolls


Ingredients
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 oz. dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg yolk
2 large eggs
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
cooking spray
1 tablespoon water
cinnamon Honey Butter

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Heat milk in a small saucepan over
medium heat, stirring occasionally, until just bubbling
around the edges, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour
into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook
attachment. Stir in sugar and 4 tablespoons butter; let
cool, stirring occasionally, until mixture is between 110
degrees F and 120 degrees F (43 degrees C and 48 degrees C)
about 10 minutes. Stir in yeast; let stand until mixture is
foamy, about 10 minutes. Add salt, egg yolk, 1 egg, and 1/2
of the flour; beat on low speed until combined, about 1
minute. Still on low speed, carefully add remaining flour,
1/2 cup at a time, and beat until dough just comes together,
about 1 minute. Dough will be very sticky and wet. Increase
speed to medium, and beat until dough pulls away from sides
of bowl and dough is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.
Coat a large bowl with cooking spray; transfer dough to
prepared bowl. Cover loosely and let rise in a warm place
until about doubled in size, about 1 hour. With a clean
hand, punch down dough and turn dough out onto a lightly
floured work surface. Press or roll dough out into a
rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Trim edges with a sharp
knife to create a perfect 16- x 8-inch rectangle. Starting
at one long end, fold dough in half to form a 16- x 4-inch
rectangle; pinch to close dough halves together. Use a sharp
knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into 16 (2-inch) squares.
Place dough squares onto a parchment paper-lined baking
sheet about 1/2-inch apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap;
set aside at room temperature until about doubled in size, 1
hour. (Itâ€™s okay if the baking sheet looks a little
crowded.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk together remaining egg and water until combined. Brush
tops of rolls with egg wash. Bake in preheated oven until
golden brown, 12 to 16 minutes. Microwave remaining 2
tablespoons butter on HIGH until melted, about 30 seconds.
Immediately brush rolls with melted butter. Serve warm with
Cinnamon Honey Butter.

1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1 tablespoon unsulphured molasses
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground ginger
Â½ teaspoon ground cloves
4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 Â½ cups powdered sugar
Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon whole milk, or more as needed

Cooking Instructions

To make the dough: Combine warm milk, yeast, and 2
tablespoons of sugar in a small bowl; stir together until
combined. Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add salt, 4
cups of the flour, and remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar to
the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.

With mixer running on low speed, add milk mixture, sour
cream, butter, molasses, and egg. Continue beating until
dough forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Switch to a dough hook
attachment. Beat on medium-low speed until dough is smooth
and elastic, 6 to 9 minutes; add remaining 1/4 cup flour 1/2
to 1 teaspoon at a time, if necessary. If the dough is
sticking to your hands and not pulling away from the sides
of the bowl, add the extra flour. Place dough in a large
bowl greased with cooking spray and turn to coat. Cover with
a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm
draft-free place until dough has doubled in size, about 1

over dough using a small offset spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch
border on one long side. Stir together brown sugar,
molasses, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves in a small bowl until
well combined. Sprinkle evenly over butter, gently pressing
down with a rolling pin to adhere mixture to butter.
Starting with one long side, roll dough into a log, pinching
seam to seal. Slice into 12 even rolls (about 1 Â½-inches
each). Place rolls in the prepared pan, leaving about a
Â½-inch space between each roll. Cover, and let rise in a
warm draft-free place until doubled in size, 45 to 60
minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15
minutes. To make the glaze: Add cream cheese and 4
tablespoons butter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with
the paddle attachment; beat on medium speed until smooth, 1
to 2 minutes. Add powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk. Beat on
medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. If desired, add
more milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, until desired consistency
is reached. Spread glaze evenly over warm rolls; serve
immediately.

Homemade Mini Cinnamon Rolls


Ingredients
Â¾ cup milk
Â¼ cup water
4 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour
â…“ cup sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
Â½ teaspoon salt
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
â…“ cup butter, melted
â…” cup brown sugar
1 Â½ teaspoons cinnamon
4 tablespoons butter, softened
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 tablespoon milk
Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups powdered sugar

Cooking Instructions

Mix together milk and water in a glass measuring cup for the
dough. Microwave mixture until it reaches 105 degrees F to
115 degrees F (40 degrees C to 46 degrees C), 30 to 60
seconds. Whisk together flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a
large bowl. Add eggs, melted butter, and milk mixture. Beat
with an electric mixer at medium speed until a soft dough
forms and begins to pull away from sides of bowl, 3 to 5
minutes. (Dough will be sticky.) Lightly grease a bowl.
Transfer dough to the bowl and turn to coat. Chill, covered,
until dough is easy to handle, at least 2 hours or up to
overnight. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans or two 8x8-inch
baking pans. Stir together brown sugar and cinnamon in a
small bowl. Punch down dough; divide in half. Roll out one
portion of dough on a lightly floured surface into a
6x16-inch rectangle. (If dough springs back when rolling,
let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.) Spread 2 tablespoons softened
butter over the dough. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon-brown
sugar mixture over butter; gently pat mixture so it adheres
to the dough. Starting on a long side, roll up dough and
pinch along seam to seal. Slice dough log into 16 (1-inch-
thick) pieces. Put rolls, cut sides down, in one of the
prepared pans. Repeat with the remaining dough, cinnamon-
sugar, and softened butter. Let rise, covered, in a warm
place until rolls nearly double in size, about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake
until rolls until golden brown, 17 to 22 minutes. Cool in
pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. Meanwhile for the icing, beat
cream cheese, softened butter, milk, and vanilla with an
electric mixer at medium speed until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes.
Gradually beat in powdered sugar until smooth. Drizzle rolls
with icing and serve warm.

How to Make Sourdough Bread with Levain


Ingredients
100 grams sourdough starter
15 grams bread flour
15 grams whole wheat flour
5 grams rye flour
35 grams water
135 grams whole wheat flour
365 grams bread flour
425 grams water
70 grams of the levain
11 grams kosher salt
2 tablespoon rice flour, or as needed for dusting banneton
2 ice cubes

Cooking Instructions

Make the Levain: Weigh out the levain ingredients in a small
bowl or jar (100g sourdough starter, 15g bread flour, 15g
whole wheat flour, 5g rye flour, 35g water). Stir together,
and leave at room temperature until very bubbly and doubled
in size, about 5 hours. Meanwhile, about 2 hours before the
levain will be ready, perform the autolyse: Stir the 135g
whole wheat flour, 365g bread flour, and 425g water together
in a bowl. Let sit for about 2 hours. If levain is ready to
use before the autolyse has gone a full 2 hours, proceed
with mixing dough anyway. Mix the dough: Weigh out 70g
levain, and add to the top of the autolyse mixture of flour
and water. Sprinkle salt around the edges. With damp hands,
pull up and fold dough from edges to the middle, turning the
bowl as you fold, until completely mixed. Cover; let rest
for 15 minutes. Cover and return the excess levain to the
refrigerator to use for a future batch of bread. Perform
first set of folds: Lift dough with wet hands at the edge
and flop to the middle; turn the bowl a few inches and
continue to flop and turn until dough begins to resist being
pulled to the center. Repeat folds twice more, 15 minutes
apart, covering dough in between. Set a timer for 30
minutes. Now turn dough out onto counter, and perform the
first stretch and fold. Stretch the dough into a rough
12-inch square. Pull 2 corners and fold the dough into
thirds; then fold the top half to the bottom. Roll the dough
forward, then form into a ball with a flat bench scraper;
return dough to the bowl and cover. Repeat the stretch and
fold process 2 more times, 30 minutes apart. Cover; let
dough bulk ferment until very bubbly and doubled in size, 4
to 5 hours. Turn dough out onto counter, and pre-shape dough
into a ball. Dust with flour, and let rest on the counter 30
minutes. Perform the final shaping: Dust the counter with
flour, and gently flop the dough over into the flour with
the bench scraper. Again, perform a stretch and fold, but
gently, to not deflate the dough. Shape into as high and
round a ball as possible using the bench scraper. Dust the
top with flour. Generously dust a banneton with rice flour,
Carefully slide the bench scraper under the dough, and turn
it over into the banneton. Now, and this is optional,
"stitch" the dough by bringing opposite pieces of the dough
up, sticking them together in the center. Dust with a little
flour. Cover; proof dough in the refrigerator for 14 hours.
One hour before baking, place the pan you will bake the
bread in, or a pizza stone, in the oven. and heat the oven
to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). After 1 hour of
preheating, turn dough out of banneton onto parchment, and
score 1/4-inch deep with a razor or sharp thin knife. Place
in bread pan, add 2 ice cubes to the pan; cover. Bake for 20
minutes at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Remove cover,
lower the heat to 450 degrees F (240 degrees C), and bake an
additional 35 minutes, or until desired doneness. Let cool 1
hour before slicing.

Mochi Donuts


Ingredients
1 Â½ cups Mochiko (sweet white rice flour, such as Asianâ€™s Best), plus more for dusting
1 cup tapioca flour
Â½ cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt
â…” cup whole milk
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg
canola oil for frying
1 Â¼ cups powdered sugar
2 tablespoons whole milk, or more as needed
Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon ground freeze dried fruit such as strawberry, mango or dragon fruit

Cooking Instructions

Combine rice flour, tapioca flour, sugar, baking powder, and
salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle
attachment. Beat on low speed until combined, 1 minute. Add
milk, butter, vanilla, and egg; beat on low speed until a
smooth dough forms about 1 to 2 minutes (dough will be
slightly sticky). Lightly dust rice flour onto a clean work
surface and turn dough onto surface. Divide dough into
quarters and working in batches, roll dough quarters into
18-inch-long ropes about 1-inch wide. Cut each rope into
1-inch pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, wetting hands as
needed to help roll (about 72 each for 9 donuts). Cut 9
square pieces of parchment paper, 5x5-inches, and place in a
single layer on a baking sheet. Arrange 8 dough balls onto
each piece parchment in a ring about 3 1/2 inches in
diameter, connecting them side by side and using water to
seal together. Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large
Dutch oven; heat over medium-high to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Place 3 dough rings, along with parchment, in
hot oil. Remove parchment with tongs once dough floats to
top of oil. Cook until golden and puffed, turning once
halfway through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack
lined with paper towels; cool 10 minutes. Repeat with
remaining dough rings. For the glaze whisk powdered sugar, 2
tablespoons milk, and vanilla together in a medium bowl.
Mixture should be the consistency of heavy cream; add up to
1 tablespoon milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, as needed to adjust
consistency. Dip tops of 4 or 5 doughnuts into the glaze;
place on wire rack (with paper towel removed). Stir 2
teaspoons dried fruit powder into remaining glaze. Dip
remaining doughnuts in the glaze; transfer to wire rack and
sprinkle with remaining fruit powder.

Pretzel Crust Pizza


Ingredients
1 Â¼ cups warm water
1 Â½ tablespoons
1 (1/4-ounce) envelope active dry yeast
3 Â½ cups
1 teaspoon
neutral cooking oil,
cooking spray
tablespoon
2 tablespoons hot water
2 cups part-skim mozzarella cheese
30 pepperoni slices
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
pretzel salt
1/3 cup whole milk
8 ounces processed cheese
1 tablespoon
Â½ teaspoon onion powder
Â½ teaspoon paprika
Â½ teaspoon
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Prepare the pizza: Place warm water,
sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a
dough hook. Whisk until just combined, and let stand until
foamy, about 5 minutes. Add flour and salt; mix on low speed
until just combined, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to
medium, and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5
minutes. Shape dough into a ball, and transfer to a large
greased bowl, rotating dough to coat all sides in oil. Cover
with plastic wrap or a clean damp towel; let rest in a warm
area until doubled in size, 25 to 30 minutes. Preheat the
oven to 425 degrees F (230 degrees C) with a pizza stone or
overturned large rimmed baking sheet on the center rack.
Grease a large 15-inch pizza pan with cooking spray. Punch
down dough, and transfer to the prepared pizza pan. Using
clean hands, press dough to the outer edge of the pan (dough
should be 15 inches in diameter). Fold 1 to 1 1/2-inches of
doughâ€™s outer edge over itself to create adefined crust
(dough should be 13 inches in diameter to the outer edge).
Combine baking soda and hot water in a small bowl. Using a
pastry brush, brush the top and outer edges of crust;
discard any remaining baking soda mixture. Bake crust on
pizza stone in preheated oven until crust is golden brown,
about 8 minutes. Meanwhile prepare the cheese sauce: Bring
milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium. Reduce
heat to low; add processed cheese, in batches, whisking
constantly until melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk in butter,
onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, and salt until smooth.
Set aside until ready to use. Spread cheese sauce evenly
over par-baked crust. Sprinkle with an even layer of
mozzarella cheese, and top evenly with pepperoni slices.
Brush outer crust with melted butter, and sprinkle evenly
with pretzel salt. Bake in the preheated oven at 425 degrees
F (230 degrees C) until mozzarella is slightly browned and
melted and crust is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove
from oven, and let cool on pizza pan for 5 minutes. Slice
and serve.

Reuben Crescent Rolls


Ingredients
2 (8-count) cans crescent rolls
8 thin slices pastrami or corned beef
4 slices Swiss cheese
1 cup sauerkraut
8 teaspoons thousand island salad dressing
1 large egg, beaten
2 teaspoons caraway seeds

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and line a
sheet pan with parchment paper. On a cutting board or work
surface, separate crescent rolls into 16 triangles, lining
them up so that the thin points of the triangles point away
from you. Cut each slice of pastrami or corned beef
diagonally, into 2 triangles, making 16. Cut each Swiss
cheese slice in half, then cut each half diagonally, to make
16 triangles. For each triangle of crescent dough, place a
triangle of meat and shape it to be slightly smaller than
the crescent dough. Add a triangle of Swiss cheese. Place 1
tablespoon sauerkraut along the bottom edge of each
triangle. Add 1/2 teaspoon Thousand Island salad dressing on
top of the sauerkraut. Roll the crescents away from you,
beginning at the wide end and rolling to the narrow point,
the same way a crescent roll is made, keeping the filling
ingredients inside the dough as it rolls. Place each
completed roll on the prepared pan. Brush each roll-up with
egg, and sprinkle with caraway seeds. Bake in the preheated
oven until golden brown and hot throughout, 21 to 25
minutes. Remove to cool on a baking rack for 3 to 5 minutes.

Sausage Gravy Kolaches


Ingredients
1/2 cup milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
1 package dry yeast
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 large egg
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour, plus more as needed
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
8 ounces ground pork breakfast sausage (or sausage links with casings removed)
1 1/2 teaspoons all purpose flour
4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
4 green onions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish
2 tablespoons milk
2 sage leaves, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne
1 large egg, beaten, divided

Cooking Instructions

Combine warm milk, yeast, sugar, salt, and melted butter in
the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attached. Add
egg and flour. Drop down dough hook and start kneading on
low speed, stopping and scraping down the sides every so
often in the beginning to make sure all the ingredients are
incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Once everything has come
together, increase speed 1 notch and continue kneading until
dough is very soft, very smooth, and slightly elastic, about
2 minutes. Transfer dough onto a work surface, knead for 1
minute, and shape into a smooth ball. Since the dough has
butter in it, it wonâ€™t be sticky. Return dough ball to a
lightly buttered bowl. Cover, and allow to rise in a warm
spot until it has doubled in size, about 90 minutes. Once
dough is risen, transfer to a work surface and punch down to
de-gas. Shape back into a ball, and weigh on a digital
scale. Divide amount by 8 and weigh out 8 equal dough
portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball, using just
enough flour to keep it from sticking. Press and flatten the
dough into a disc about 3 1/2-inches wide and a 1/2-inch
thick. Shape with your hands to make a small indention in
the middle. Transfer to a silpat-lined baking sheet. Cover
and let proof until almost doubles in size, 45 to 60
minutes. Combine cooled sausage, cream cheese, green onions,
milk, sage, Â½ of the beaten egg, salt, pepper, and cayenne
in a bowl. Mix filling into a thick paste with a spoon.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) Use
slightly damp fingertips to press a well into the center of
each kolache to place the filling. Be sure to leave no more
that 3/4-inch of un-pressed dough around the outside. Do not
press all the way through the dough to the baking sheet.
Brush each kolache with remaining egg wash. Fill evenly with
the sausage cream cheese mixture. Bake in the preheated oven
until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven,
transfer to a wire rack, and allow to rest for 10 to 15
minutes before serving. Top with sliced green onions for
garnish.

Sour Cream Donuts


Ingredients
2 Â¼ cups bleached cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
Â¾ teaspoon kosher salt
Â½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
Â¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
â…” cup sour cream, room temperature
Â½ cup granulated sugar
2 large egg yolks, room temperature
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
vegetable oil as needed for frying
4 Â½ cups powdered sugar
Â½ cup unsalted butter, melted
6 tablespoons hot water
1 Â½ teaspoons light corn syrup
Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt
Â¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon
together in a bowl until well combined. Whisk sour cream,
granulated sugar, egg yolks, melted butter, oil, and vanilla
together in a large bowl until well combined. Gradually fold
flour mixture into sour cream mixture just until combined.
(Dough will be quite soft and sticky.) Cover, and chill in
the refrigerator until dough is cold and just slightly
firmed, about 2 hours. Turn dough out onto a heavily-floured
surface and pat or roll to 3/8- to 1/2-inch thickness,
flouring hands or rolling pin as needed. Cut dough using a
floured 3 Â½-inch round cutter. Cut holes in the center of
the dough circles using a floured 1 Â¼-inch round cutter.
Transfer dough rings to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Reroll, and cut dough scraps, repeating process as needed.
Heat 3 inches of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat
until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F to 365
degrees F (182 degrees C to 185 degrees C). Fry 1 to 2
donuts at a time until golden brown and cooked through,
about 1 to 1 Â½ minutes per side, adjusting heat as necessary
to maintain oil temperature. Transfer donuts to a baking
sheet lined with paper towels using a spider strainer. Let
drain, and cool for 5 minutes (see note). Whisk together
powdered sugar, melted butter, hot water, corn syrup, salt,
and vanilla in a large bowl for the glaze until smooth and
well combined. Place 1 warm donut in the powdered sugar
mixture, craggy side up; use a spoon to coat donut
completely in the glaze. Remove donut from glaze using two
forks placed underneath; let excess drip off, and then
transfer donut to a wire rack placed over a rimmed baking
sheet. Repeat with remaining donuts and glaze. Let donuts
stand until glaze is set before serving, about 25 minutes.

Thousand Layer Chocolate Brioche


Ingredients
Â¾ cup warm whole milk
1 package active dry yeast
4 Â½ cups all-purpose flour
3 large eggs, beaten
â…“ cup white granulated sugar
1 teaspoon fine salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, very soft
4 tablespoons unsalted butter for laminating dough
Â½ cup dark chocolate chunks
1 large whole egg for brushing
coarse sea salt
white granulated sugar

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Combine warm milk and dry active
yeast in the bowl of your stand mixer; let stand for 10
minutes. Add flour, eggs, sugar, and salt. Use the dough
hook to knead the mixture until the flour almost disappears,
about 1 minute. Add the soft room temperature butter, and
continue kneading the dough until a very smooth ball of
dough forms, 4 to 5 minutes. Set dough into a lightly
buttered bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until
doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours. Punch down the dough and
divide in 2 pieces. Form each half into a smooth ball and
transfer each one into a plastic bag. Refrigerate bags
overnight for best results or the dough can be used
immediately. Each half of the dough will make 4 brioche.
When ready to make, roll and stretch dough into a 14 x 10
inch rectangle. Spread 4 tablespoons of soft room
temperature butter over two thirds of the dough, stopping
1/2 inch from the edge. Fold unbuttered third up over the
top, and then the opposite end to complete the trifold.
Gently press and seal the edges together. Fold in thirds
again to form a square. Wrap and place in the freezer until
cold and slightly firm, about 15 minutes. Roll the dough out
into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick, or thin enough to
fold, and repeat the two folding in thirds step. Wrap and
place in the freezer again until cold and slightly firm, 15
more minutes. A little bit of water can be used to help the
dough stick if needed. Roll dough out into a rectangle
again, just like in the previous step. Fold into thirds, but
keep as a rectangle (do not make the second fold). Wrap and
place in the freezer until cold and slightly firm, about 15
minutes. Roll dough into a 12 x 6 inch rectangle and place
in the freezer until cold and slightly firm, about 15
minutes. Trim off about 1/8 inch of dough from the sides and
cut into 4 rectangles that are about 6 x 3 inches. Start
with 1 piece (keeping the others in the fridge so they stay
cool) and make two cuts starting 1/2 inch from top, all the
way to the bottom to create 3 strips of dough. Braid
together, and seal at bottom. Flip over and add about 1
tablespoon of dark chocolate chunks along the center of the
braided dough, or more to taste. Roll up from the smaller
end to create a knot. Place seam side down in buttered
muffin tin. After all braids are done, cover, and let rise
in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat
the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush brioche
with egg wash, and sprinkle very lightly with some coarse
salt. Then sprinkle very generously with the granulated
sugar. Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until
nicely browned, 20 to 25 minutes. If brioches are getting
too dark, tent with aluminum foil after 15 minutes. Let cool
in the pan for about 5 minutes and then transfer onto a rack
to cool completely before serving. Serve and enjoy!

Triple Coffee Sweet Rolls


Ingredients
1/4 cup espresso powder
2 cups milk,
2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon espresso powder
1 tablespoon cocoa
1 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar
3 tablespoons espresso or strong coffee, or more as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine 1/4 cup instant espresso and hot milk in the bowl of
a stand mixer, and let cool until just warm to the touch,
about 95 degrees F (35 degrees C). Add yeast, egg, white
sugar, salt, and 6 tablespoons melted butter. Add most of
the flour, attach the dough hook, and knead on low speed
until everything comes together and begins to pull away from
the sides of the bowl. Turn mixer speed up a notch, and
continue to knead until a smooth, soft, elastic dough forms,
adding in remaining flour as needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove
dough from the mixer, form into a ball, and place back in
the bowl. Cover and let it rise in a warm place until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, make filling. Melt
1/2 cup butter in a small pan over medium heat. Stir in
brown sugar, cocoa, and 1 tablespoon instant espresso
powder. Once combined, remove from heat and let cool. As
soon as butter starts to cool and solidify, stir to form a
thick, spreadable paste. Reserve until needed. Once dough
has risen, use your hands to press out the air, and reshape
into a ball. For best results, transfer dough to a plastic
bag and place in the refrigerator overnight. Dough can be
used right away if need be. Very lightly flour a work
surface. Turn dough out onto the work surface, press into a
rectangle, and very lightly dust the top with flour. Roll
out into a 12x18-inch rectangle. Spread filling evenly to
the edges, leaving a few inches along one of the long sides
free of filling. Lightly brush exposed dough with water;
this will help to seal the seam. Beginning with the long
side that has filling, roll dough and filling toward the
long side with exposed dough to form a uniform log,
finishing with the seam on the bottom. Generously butter a
9x12- or 13-inch baking dish or pan, and, if desired, line
the bottom with buttered parchment. Score the log of dough
into 12 equal portions, and then cut each portion with a
piece of string as shown. Place cut rolls into the prepared
pan. Cover rolls and leave to rise in a warm spot until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375
degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until
puffed, golden brown at the edges, and an instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center, reads 200 degrees F
(95 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes
before icing. Whisk together confectionerâ€™s sugar with 3 to
4 tablespoons of espresso or strong coffee, or enough to
form an icing that can be drizzled over with a spoon.
Drizzle icing over rolls and let cool before serving, or
enjoy slightly warm.

cheddar biscuits


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Combine mozzarella cheese and cream cheese in a large
microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave on high power
until slightly melted, about 45 seconds. Remove from
microwave and stir. Repeat, heating for about 20 seconds
more. Remove from microwave again and stir; consistency
should be very sticky and cheese should be completely
melted. Return to microwave, if necessary, until all cheese
is melted. Mix almond flour, eggs, baking powder, and garlic
powder together in a bowl. Add mixture to the large bowl
with melted cheese and mix well. Add Cheddar cheese and stir
into the dough. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on a flat
surface and dust lightly with almond flour. Pour dough onto
the middle of the plastic wrap and roll up to form a ball.
Place in the refrigerator until slightly hardened, 20 to 30
minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Grease a dark baking sheet with butter. Remove dough from
the refrigerator and cut into 8 equal-sized pieces. Roll
each into a ball and place on the prepared baking sheet,
spacing equally and avoiding the sides, as biscuits will
spread while cooking. Bake in the preheated oven until
golden brown, checking at 10 minutes. Remove from oven
immediately and cool completely before serving, about 15
minutes.

Charred Red Cabbage and Carrot Salad


Ingredients
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 1/2 pounds red cabbage -
1/2 red onion,
2 large carrots
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1 tablespoon honey, or to taste
1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup green onions

Cooking Instructions

Line a baking sheet with foil, and grease with a few
teaspoons of vegetable oil. Arrange cabbage slices, cut side
up if possible, on the sheet, and drizzle remaining
vegetable oil evenly over cabbage. Set an oven rack about 7
inches from the heat source and preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler.
Broil until the surface of cabbage is lightly charred, 4 to
6 minutes. Times will vary depending on your oven, so watch
closely during each charring step. Use a spatula and tongs
to turn cabbage over; return to the broiler to char the
other side of cabbage, 3 to 6 minutes. Once both sides of
cabbage are lightly charred, scatter over sliced onions and
use a vegetable peeler to make long, thick strips of carrot
over the top. Arrange carrot strips evenly on top, and
return pan to the broiler. Broil until carrots and onions
begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle salt, garam
masala (or any prepared curry powder), and cayenne, and use
tongs to mix evenly. Because vegetables will shrink as they
cook, use a spatula to move them in from the edges of the
pan, removing empty space between them, and forming a nice,
even rectangle. Return pan to the broiler; broil until
cabbage is tender, and is charred to your liking, a few
minutes more. Transfer into a bowl, and dress with honey,
vinegar, and more salt if needed. Stir in olive oil and
green onions. Serve warm, room temperature, or cold.

Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwich


Ingredients
2 slices bacon
4 teaspoons butter, divided
3 large eggs
1 pinch black pepper
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
4 slices bread

Cooking Instructions

Place bacon in a nonstick skillet and cook over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 7
minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Remove bacon to
a drip line tray. Drain off bacon grease for another use.
Wash out the skillet. Whisk eggs with salt and pepper in a
small bowl until frothy. Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the
nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs; let
cook for 30 seconds. Lift the edges of the omelet so that
the uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges and comes into
contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to
move the uncooked egg. Repeat until the top is set, about 3
minutes; reduce heat to low. Meanwhile, chop bacon roughly;
sprinkle over omelet. Sprinkle with cheese; allow cheese to
melt, 1 to 2 minutes. Meanwhile, butter 2 slices of bread
with 1/2 teaspoon butter each. Lay bread, buttered side up,
side-by-side over omelet, leaving about 1 inch between
slices. The melted cheese will help the bread adhere. Run a
spatula around the entire omelet to loosen from the skillet.
Carefully turn the omelet over so buttered side of bread is
in contact with the skillet. Cook until bread is toasted and
golden, about 2 minutes. Using the spatula, fold in edges of
omelet to align with sides of the bread. Cut omelet along
center with the spatula to form 2 sandwiches. Butter 2
remaining bread slices with remaining butter; place butter
side up on each sandwich. Turn sandwiches; cook until
golden, about 2 minutes more. Serve and enjoy immediately!

it. Cook until bubbles begin to form on surface of pancakes
and edges look dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, and cook until
fluffy and slightly firm, about 1 minute. Repeat with
remaining batter, adding butter and adjusting heat as
needed. Divide pancakes evenly among 4 plates; drizzle
evenly with frosting and sprinkle evenly with topping.

Chef John’s Tortilla de Patatas


Ingredients
2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or russet potatoes, peeled
1 yellow onion
5 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 cup olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Slice potatoes and onions with a very sharp knife or
mandoline into 1/8-inch thick slices. Combine eggs, 1/2
teaspoon salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl and
whisk very thoroughly; set aside. Add 1/3 cup olive oil to a
large nonstick pan and set heat to medium-high. Add
potatoes, onions, and remaining salt. Cook, tossing and
stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, and some
onions and potatoes are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
Between stirrings, cover potatoes to reduce cooking time and
keep in moisture. For less browning, reduce heat to medium.
Stir potato mixture into egg mixture with a spatula. Cover
and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Add remaining olive oil
to an 8- or 9-inch nonstick pan, and set the pan over
medium-high heat. Pour in egg and potato mixture, and smooth
the top. Cook, covered, for about 4 minutes or until the
bottom is browned and the edges of tortilla begin to firm
up. Slide tortilla out onto a plate, cover with another
plate, and flip the plates over to invert. Slide tortilla
back into the pan, and place back over medium-high heat.
Cook, uncovered, until the tortilla is fully set, about 2
minutes more. Tortilla will spring back lightly when pressed
in the middle with a finger if eggs are fully cooked. If it
feels soft or mushy when pressed, cook for a few minutes
more, unless you prefer the tortilla less than fully set.
Slip tortilla onto a serving plate, and serve hot, warm, or
room temperature.

Crescent Breakfast Squares


Ingredients
2 12x16-inch parchment paper sheets
2 (12 ounce) packages crescent roll dough (such as PillsburyÂ® Grands!â„¢)
8 slices deli ham
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or more to taste
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
Â½ cup diced onion
Â½ cup diced red bell pepper
10 large eggs
1 tablespoon half-and-half cream or heavy whipping cream
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
8 slices Swiss cheese
1 tablespoon bagel seasoning (such as Trader Joe'sÂ® Everything But the Bagel Seasoning Blend)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread each
sheet of parchment on a work surface. Unroll crescent dough,
and place the contents of one can on each sheet. Roll dough
into two 10x15-inch rectangles, making sure the perforations
are sealed, one rectangle per parchment. Slide one dough
rectangle with its parchment paper onto a 13x18-inch sheet
pan; reserve the second rectangle for later use. Working
with the first piece of dough, spread ham slices over the
dough, leaving about 1/2-inch on all sides. Spread Dijon
mustard in a thin layer over the ham slices. Melt 1
tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook
and stir onions and bell peppers until slightly softened,
about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low; add 1 tablespoon
butter to skillet with vegetables until melted. Whisk eggs,
half-and-half or cream, salt, and pepper together in a large
bowl until well blended. Pour egg mixture into the skillet
with vegetables. Cook, using a spatula to lift and move,
until eggs are just set and still wet looking. Spoon lightly
cooked egg mixture in an even layer over the ham slices,
maintaining the 1/2-inch dough border all around. Place
sliced Swiss cheese in a single layer over the eggs. Place
the second dough rectangle over all, using the parchment to
help you align it. Carefully peel off the parchment. Moisten
fingertips and press the edges of the two dough rectangles
together, then use a fork to crimp. Melt remaining 1
tablespoon butter; brush over the top of the dough with a
pastry brush. Sprinkle bagel seasoning over all. Bake in the
preheated oven until nicely browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove to cool on a wire rack for about 15 minutes. Slice
into serving pieces with a sharp knife.

Halloumi and Zucchini Frittata


Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large zucchini, grated and squeezed dry
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
4 large eggs
4 ounces halloumi cheese, sliced

Cooking Instructions

Heat olive oil in a small, ovenproof skillet over medium
heat. Add zucchini and a pinch of salt and cook until soft,
about 5 minutes. Add chopped mint and dill, and cook 1
minute more. Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a small bowl.
Pour into the hot skillet with the zucchini and briefly
stir. Cook without stirring to allow the bottom of the
frittata to set, about 2 minutes. Use a spatula around the
edges of the skillet to ensure that the frittata isn't
sticking as the bottom starts to set. Set an oven rack about
6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's
broiler. Lay the slices of halloumi on the top of the
frittata as the edges start to set. Place the skillet under
the broiler until the top of the frittata is fully set and
cheese is slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Serve

1 cup cheesecake filling, such as PhiladelphiaÂ® Cheesecake No-Bak
1/4 cup lemon curd
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water

Cooking Instructions

water to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-
high heat. Reduce to medium low and cook, without stirring,

Naked Eggs Benedict


Ingredients
2 teaspoons butter
4 slices deli ham
2 large eggs
1 pinch salt
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon water
salt to taste
2 tablespoons unsalted butter,
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 English muffin
1 teaspoon chives to garnish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2
(5 ounce) ramekins (or 2 wells of a standard muffin tin)

ham, being sure to get the edges even around the top. Crack
1 egg into a small bowl; gently transfer to a ham-lined
ramekin; repeat with the second egg. Season each egg with
salt and cayenne, to taste. Bake in the preheated oven until
the whites are just barely set, and the yolks are still soft
and a little runny, 20 to 25 minutes. The eggs will continue
to cook and set more firmly once removed from the oven if
left in the hot ramekins. When eggs have 10 minutes cook
time remaining, make lemon butter sauce. Add lemon juice,
water, and salt to a small pan. Bring to a simmer over
medium heat, and simmer until liquid has reduced by about
half, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to lowest setting and add
butter slices. Start swirling and shaking the pan until
butter is almost fully emulsified, then turn off the heat.
Continue swirling pan until butter is entirely melted.
Taste; add cayenne or hot sauce if using. Keep pan in a warm
spot until needed. Sauce will thicken slightly as it cools
Toast and butter English muffins, transfer baked ham and
eggs onto muffin halves, and spoon warm sauce over. Sprinkle
with chives and serve immediately.

Strawberry Rhubarb Drop Biscuits


Ingredients
1 1/4 cups rhubarb
1 1/4 cups strawberries
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stick unsalted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons fruit syrup
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 large egg (optional)
2 teaspoons water (optional)
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into
1/4-inch pieces; place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries
and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss to combine, cover, and let
fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Combine
flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing
bowl; whisk to combine. Drain fruit in a strainer set over a
bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices that pass through. Grate
frozen butter into the flour mixture, while stirring with a
fork several times to coat butter pieces with flour. Add 1/4
cup sugar, and drained fruit, mixing with a fork until fruit
is coated with flour. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved
fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk. Mix with a fork just
until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough.
If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little
more buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a
little more flour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230
degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat. Scoop or
spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking
sheet. Whisk together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush
biscuits with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack
and let cool completely. Mix powdered sugar, lemon zest, and
lemon juice together in a small bowl for the lemon icing.
Fill icing into a piping bag or a plastic bag with the tip
cut off and drizzle icing over cooled biscuits.

Tres Leches Pancakes


Ingredients
2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/3 cup half and half
1 (15.25 oz) box French vanilla cake mix
1 1/4 cups almond milk
3 large eggs, lightly beaten
tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1/2 cup whipped cream, or as needed (optional) whipped cream, or as needed (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or as needed (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and half
and half in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring
to a boil, stirring constantly for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove

consistency will be on the thinner side. Add cake mix,
almond milk, eggs, and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil to a
large bowl, and beat vigorously by hand for 2 minutes. Heat
a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and lightly
coat with remaining vegetable oil. Add 1/4 cup of the batter
for each pancake. Cook until edges begin to puff up, small
bubbles appear, pop, and leave small holes, 2 to 3 minutes.
Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on the other side,
about 2 minutes more. Serve pancakes warm with a drizzle of
the tres leches sauce, a dollop of whipped cream, and
sprinkle of cinnamon.

omelets


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Add eggs to a bowl, along with water, soy sauce, mirin,
salt, sugar, and cayenne. Use a fork to beat eggs until
whites are completely incorporated. Transfer egg mixture
into a pourable measuring cup. Set a 10-inch non-stick pan
over medium heat. Mix sesame and vegetable oil in a small
bowl, and use a brush to oil the pan. Pour in 1/3 of egg
mixture. Tilt the pan to cover the bottom with eggs. Cook
until omelet is about halfway set, then use a spatula to
turn over about 1 inch of edge toward the center on 3 sides
to square the shape on those 3 sides. If eggs seem to be
cooking too fast, reduce heat to medium-low. Use a spatula
to roll the omelet toward the rounder side, to form a
rectangular roll, about 2 inches wide by 8 inches long.
Slide omelet over to about 3 inches from the edge of the
pan, and brush more oil over the pan surface. Pour the
second 1/3 of eggs around the omelet. Lift omelet slightly
with the spatula so that some eggs flow underneath. Raise
heat back to medium, if it was reduced. When egg layer is
halfway set, use a spatula to roll this layer up and over
the already-folded omelet in the pan, and continue to roll
into a rectangle. Add remaining 1/3 of egg mixture, and
repeat cooking and rolling steps to make the final layer.
Transfer omelet onto plastic wrap, and use it to shape the
omelet, before wrapping and rolling it into a tight package;
cover with a towel and let rest for 5 minutes. Unwrap, slice
into 6 or 8 pieces, and serve on a warm plate. Sprinkle with
furikake.

Bougatsa


Ingredients
4 large eggs
2/3 cup white sugar
3 cups whole milk
1/2 cup semolina flour
1 cup unsalted butter
2 tablespoons lemon zest
2 tablespoons juice
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup unsalted butter
18 (14x9-inch) frozen phyllo pastry sheets
2 teaspoons confectioner's sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Cooking Instructions

Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Beat eggs with a stand mixer fitted with a
whisk attachment on medium speed until foamy, about 1
minute. Add white sugar; beat on medium speed until thick
and foamy, 4 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat milk in a large
saucepan over medium-low, stirring occasionally, until milk
begins to simmer. With mixer on low speed, slowly pour hot
milk into egg mixture, beating until fully combined, about
30 seconds. Return milk mixture to saucepan. Place saucepan
over medium-low heat, and cook, whisking constantly, until
mixture begins to simmer and thickens slightly, 3 to 4
minutes. Gradually whisk in semolina flour; cook, stirring
constantly, until thickened to a porridge consistency, 1 to
2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Gradually whisk cold
butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, into mixture in saucepan
until emulsified, about 2 minutes. Whisk in lemon zest,
lemon juice, and vanilla. Let custard stand at room
temperature while preparing baking pan, stirring
occasionally. Brush bottom and sides of a nonstick 13- x
9-inch baking pan with about 1 tablespoon of the melted
butter. Gently unfold and place phyllo sheets on a clean
work surface; cover using a damp clean kitchen towel to keep
phyllo moist while you work. Layer 8 phyllo sheets in the
prepared baking pan, lightly brushing each sheet with melted
butter. Spread custard over phyllo in an even layer. Top
with 2 phyllo sheets, lightly brushing each sheet with
melted butter and stretching sheets to cover sides of baking
pan. Working with remaining 8 phyllo sheets, 1 sheet at a
time, place phyllo sheet on work surface; lightly brush with
melted butter. Starting from 1 short end, fold phyllo sheet
accordion-style to create a long strip with 2-inch-wide
pleats. Place folded phyllo strip crosswise in baking pan
with pleats facing up. Repeat brushing and folding process
with remaining 7 phyllo sheets and melted butter, placing
strips side by side to completely cover baking pan. Bake in
the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and crispy,
40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven, and let bougatsa cool
slightly at room temperature for 30 minutes. Dust evenly
with confectioner's sugar and cinnamon. Slice into squares,
and serve warm or at room temperature.

Chocolate-Glazed Hazelnut Mousse Cake


Ingredients
2 tablespoons hazelnuts, toasted and skins rubbed off
3 tablespoons sugar
Â½ cup all-purpose flour
Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
â…› teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
3 tablespoons cold water
Â½ cup chocolate hazelnut spread such as Nutella
Â½ cup mascarpone
1 Â½ cups chilled heavy cream
2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
3 tablespoons sugar
5 tablespoons heavy cream
3 Â½ ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), chopped

Cooking Instructions

For shortbread base: Put oven rack in middle position and
preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Invert bottom of springform
pan (to make it easier to slide shortbread base off bottom),
then lock on side of pan and line bottom with a round of
parchment paper. Pulse hazelnuts with sugar in a food
processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add flour, butter,
cocoa, and salt and pulse just until a dough forms. Press
dough evenly onto bottom of springform pan with your
fingers. Prick all over with a fork, then bake until just
dry to the touch, about 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer base in
pan to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Remove
side of pan and carefully slide out parchment from under
shortbread, then reattach side of pan around shortbread
base. Make mousse while shortbread cools: Sprinkle gelatin
over water in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan and let
stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Heat gelatin mixture
over low heat, stirring, just until gelatin is melted, about
2 minutes. Whisk in chocolate hazelnut spread until combined
and remove from heat. Whisk together mascarpone and
chocolate hazelnut mixture in a large bowl. Beat together
cream, cocoa powder, and sugar in another large bowl with an
electric mixer at low speed until just combined, then
increase speed to high and beat until cream just holds soft
peaks. Whisk one third of whipped cream into mascarpone
mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whipped cream
until well combined. Spoon filling onto shortbread base in
pan, gently smoothing top, then chill, covered, at least 3
hours. Make ganache and glaze cake: Bring cream to a simmer
in a small heavy saucepan and remove from heat. Add
chocolate and let stand 1 minute, then gently whisk until
completely melted and smooth. Transfer ganache to a small
bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until slightly
thickened but still pourable, about 20 minutes. Run a warm
thin knife around inside of springform pan, then remove
side. Slide cake off bottom of pan and transfer to a serving
plate. Pour ganache onto top of cake and spread, allowing
excess ganache to drip down sides.

Lemon Coconut Cake


Ingredients
6 large egg yolks,
2/3 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons lemon zest
3/4 cup lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes
3 cups cake flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup sour cream,
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup coconut milk
6 large egg whites,
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
4 cups confectioner's sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon coconut milk
1 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes

Cooking Instructions

For lemon curd, add egg yolks, sugar, lemon zest, lemon
juice, salt, and butter to a small non-reactive saucepan
over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until
mixture begins to simmer and has thickened, 8 to 12 minutes.
Pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl,
using a spatula or wooden spoon to push the mixture through.
Cover with a piece of plastic wrap directly touching the top
of the curd, and refrigerate until chilled. For cakes,
preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease 3 8-inch round cake pans, and line the bottoms with
parchment paper. Place coconut flakes into a food processor
or blender, and pulse a few times until coconut flakes are
finely chopped. Set aside. Sift cake flour, baking powder,
salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. In a separate
large bowl, beat butter, vegetable oil, and sugar together
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 4
minutes. Add in sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and mix
until thoroughly combined. Add in 1/2 of flour mixture and
mix until just combined. Add in coconut milk and mix until
just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until
just combined. In a separate clean bowl, combine egg whites
and cream of tartar. With clean beaters, beat egg whites on
medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.
Add 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the batter, and fold
just until no streaks of whites remain. Add in remaining egg
white mixture and gently fold until no streaks of white
remain. Divide batter evenly between the 3 prepared cake
pans. Bake in the preheated oven until tops of cakes spring
back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cakes to
cool in pans for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack
to cool completely. For frosting, cut cold butter into
1/2-inch pieces. Place into a bowl. Starting on low speed,
beat butter with an electric mixer until just loosened.
Gradually increase the mixer speed, and beat butter until
smooth, about 2 minutes. Add in cold cream cheese, and beat
on medium-high speed until completely smooth and combined,
about 3 minutes. Add in confectionerâ€™s sugar; beat until
thoroughly combined. Add in lemon zest, vanilla, and salt
and mix until combined. Add in remaining confectionerâ€™s
sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add in 1 tablespoon cold coconut milk and beat mixture on
medium-high speed for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. If
frosting is a bit too soft to spread onto the cake layers,
place it into the fridge for about 10 minutes, or until it
is easier to use. To assemble the cake, place one cake layer
onto a cake plate or serving platter. Spread a thin layer of
cream cheese frosting over the top of the cake. Pipe a ring
of frosting around the top edge of the cake. Place about 2
tablespoons of lemon curd in the center of the frosting
ring, and smooth into an even layer. Stack another cake
layer on top of the first, and repeat the process of
frosting and filling. When the last cake layer is stacked on
top, frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer
of frosting. Use your hands to press the toasted coconut
flakes onto the sides of the cake. If desired, drizzle or
swirl the top of cake with some of the extra lemon curd.
Place cake into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes
before serving.

Peach Custard Pie


Ingredients
1 pie crust shell
2 peaches
4 large eggs
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup whole milk
1/2 cup butter

Cooking Instructions

To blind bake the crust (optional): Chill pastry-filled pie
pan at least 20 minutes before baking to prevent shrinkage.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line
pastry with parchment or a double layer of aluminum foil and
a layer of pie weights or dried beans. Bake in the preheated
oven for about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, carefully
remove the foil and weights, and let cool to room
temperature, about 20 minutes. The base of the crust will
have turned a very light golden brown. Reduce the oven
temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). For custard:
combine eggs, white sugar, and brown sugar in a bowl, and
whisk vigorously until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.
Add flour, cornmeal, salt, vanilla, vinegar, milk, and
butter, and whisk vigorously until you achieve a smooth,
emulsified batter, about 2 minutes. Arrange 12 peach slices
on the bottom of the crust. Whisk batter again, and slowly
ladle into the crust, being careful not to move the peach
slices out of place. Bake in the preheated oven at 350
degrees F (175 degrees C) until top is browned and a very
sharp knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 50 to
60 minutes. The pie should not be liquid, but jiggle when
the pie dish is moved back and forth. Let cool completely
before serving. For best results, chill in the refrigerator
before serving.

Perfect Cheesecake with Strawberry Topping


Ingredients
14 graham crackers
1/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, melted
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs
2 quarts fresh strawberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup water

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Break
graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor. Add sugar
and pulse until large crumbs form. Add butter and pulse just
until combined and mixture resembles slightly wet sand.
Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan; press mixture
lightly into the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of the
pan. Bake in the preheated oven until fragrant and slightly
golden brown around the edges, about 8 minutes. Let cool.
Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil. Place cream cheese
in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using a paddle attachment,
whip cheese on medium speed just until smooth, to avoid
incorporating too much air. Add sugar and beat until smooth,
scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add in sour
cream, vanilla, lemon juice and salt and blend until just
combined. With the mixer on low speed, add eggs, one at a
time, mixing until each egg is fully incorporated, then mix
until just combined and smooth, scraping down the sides of
the bowl as needed. Pour mixture into the prepared crust.
Wrap bottom and sides of pan well with heavy duty aluminum
foil. Place the pan inside a large deep roasting pan and set
pan in the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the
roasting pan around the cheesecake without letting any water
inside the foil wrap or the cheesecake. Bake in the
preheated oven until the center is very slightly jiggly,
about 50 minutes. Carefully remove pans from the oven and
allow cheesecake to cool in the water bath for 15 to 20
minutes. After about 10 minutes, just when cheesecake starts
to release itself from the sides, run a knife around the
sides. Remove wrapped cheesecake from water bath and place
on a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Unwrap
cheesecake and place in refrigerator until fully chilled and
ready to serve, at least 4 hours. Place 1/2 of strawberries
in a large saucepan and stir in sugar, lemon, vanilla,
cornstarch, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat,
stirring often. Reduce heat to medium high and allow mixture
to simmer until berries are softened. Using a potato masher,
mash strawberries until slightly chunky; continue to simmer
until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in
remaining strawberries, and let cool to room temperature.
Refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve cheesecake slices
with strawberry topping.

S'mores Cupcakes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
6 tablespoons brown sugar
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch cinnamon
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon espresso powder
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup brown sugar
1 large egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup sour cream
18 large marshmallows
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
2/3 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon almond extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2
cupcake pans with liners. Prepare the crust: Mix graham
cracker crumbs, melted butter, brown sugar, salt, nutmeg,
and cinnamon together in a small bowl until combined. Place
1 packed tablespoon of crumb mixture into the bottom of
about 18 cupcake liners and press into an even layer. Bake
in the preheated oven until graham cracker crusts are
slightly darker in color, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow crusts to
cool. Prepare cupcakes: Whisk boiling water, cocoa powder,
and espresso powder together In a small bowl or measuring
cup until smooth and combined. Set aside to cool slightly.
Beat butter, vegetable oil, and brown sugar in a large bowl
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3
minutes. Add in egg, vanilla, and salt. Beat for an
additional 3 minutes on medium-high speed. Add in cocoa
powder mixture and beat until thoroughly incorporated. Add
in cake flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and mix until
just combined. Add in sour cream; mix until just combined.
Spoon about 2 heaped tablespoons of cake batter over each
graham cracker crust, making sure to fill each liner no more
than 2/3 full. (There may be extra batter to make 1 or 2
extra cupcakes without a graham cracker crust. Simply put
that batter into an empty liner, filling no more than 2/3
full, and bake as a plain chocolate cupcake). Bake in the
preheated oven, 1 pan at a time, until tops of the cupcakes
spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow
cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before carefully
removing to a wire rack to cool completely. To prepare
frosting, place an oven rack directly below the oven's
broiler; preheat broiler. Line a baking sheet with parchment
paper and lightly grease it. Place large marshmallows about
1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Place pan under broiler
and cook until marshmallows are golden brown and puffy,
rotating the pan often to ensure the tops of the
marshmallows brown evenly without burning, about 1 minute.
Remove pan from oven and allow marshmallows to cool. Place
egg whites, white sugar, cold water, cream of tartar, and
pinch of salt in a very large heatproof mixing bowl. Place
the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water (do not allow
the bottom of the bowl to touch the water), and begin to
beat the mixture on low speed with an electric hand mixer.
Gradually increase speed to medium-high and continue to whip
mixture over hot water until mixture holds stiff peaks, 8 to
10 minutes. Remove from heat and beat for 1 minute more. Add
in toasted marshmallows, vanilla, and almond extract.
Beginning on low speed and gradually increasing the speed to
high, beat mixture until completely smooth and no lumps of
toasted marshmallow remain, and the mixture once again holds
stiff peaks, 5 to 7 minutes. Place mixture into a large
piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Generously pipe
marshmallow frosting onto the top of each cooled cupcake. If
desired, use a kitchen torch to caramelize the frosting
until golden brown.

time, until tops of cupcakes spring back when lightly
touched, 22 to 26 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan
for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool
completely, about 30 minutes Chill cupcakes in the
refrigerator for about 1 hour. This will make them easier to
cut and fill. Cream cheese whipped cream: Beat chilled cream
cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt together until
smooth. Add in 1/2 cup cold heavy cream, and mix on low
until mixture is smooth. Add in remaining heavy cream; beat
on medium-high until mixture holds stiff peaks. If desired,
place mixture into a piping bag fitted with an open star tip
(such as a WiltonÂ® 1M). Place piping bag in refrigerator
until ready to use. Remove cupcakes from refrigerator.
Remove the liners and cut tops off cupcakes. Pipe a layer of
whipped cream on bottom half of cupcakes; top with about 1
to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. Place tops of cupcakes
back on, and lightly press down to adhere. Pipe more whipped
cream on top of cupcakes and top with another 1 to 2
teaspoons strawberry mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for
30 minutes before serving.

Strawberry Oreo Cheesecake


Ingredients
2 cups fresh strawberries
6 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 1/4 cups OreoÂ® cookies
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
16 small strawberries
4 OreoÂ® cookies
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
1 pinch ground nutmeg
3 large eggs

Cooking Instructions

Strawberry sauce: Place strawberries, sugar, lemon juice,
and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook,
stirring often, until strawberries soften and release their
juices, about 10 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash
strawberries. Stir water and cornstarch together in a small
bowl. Add cornstarch mixture to strawberries, and cook,
stirring constantly, until mixture begins to thicken, 1 to 2
minutes more. Remove from heat, and carefully pour mixture
through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl; use the back of a
wooden spoon or spatula to press out as much juice as
possible. Discard pulp. Place strawberry sauce, uncovered,
into the refrigerator to cool. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom of a
9-inch springform pan. Oreo crust: Combine cookie crumbs,
brown sugar, and salt. Stir in melted butter until
thoroughly combined. Press mixture evenly into the bottom
and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Place pan on a
rimmed baking sheet. Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15
minutes. Remove from the oven, leaving oven on, and allow to
cool for 10 minutes. Cheesecake filling: Beat cream cheese
and sugar until thoroughly smooth and combined. Add in heavy
cream, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, almond extract,
and nutmeg; beat on low speed until smooth. Add in eggs, and
beat on low speed just until eggs are incorporated. Pour
half of filling into crust. Drizzle 6 tablespoons of cooled
strawberry sauce over filling. Pour remaining filling into
the pan, taking care to cover strawberry sauce. Reserve
remaining strawberry sauce, covered, in the refrigerator
until ready to serve the cheesecake. Return cheesecake to
the oven and bake until the top looks set, and edges are
beginning to turn golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Turn oven
off, prop the door slightly ajar, and leave cheesecake to
cool in the oven for 1 hour. Remove cheesecake to a wire
rack. Run a knife around the top edge of cheesecake to
loosen it slightly from the pan; allow to cool in the pan to
room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8
hours. When ready to serve, toss halved strawberries into
reserved strawberry sauce until thoroughly coated. Remove
cheesecake from springform pan; place on a serving platter.
Pour strawberries and sauce on top of the cake, and turn all
the berries cut-side-down. Garnish with halved Oreos, if
desired. Keep extra cheesecake stored in the fridge.

Tartufo


Ingredients
1 quart vanilla ice cream (such as Haagen Dazs
8 maraschino cherries (such as Luxardo
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
5 tablespoons coconut oil
36 chocolate wafer cookies chocolate wafer cookies
1/2 cup roasted pistachios (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Let ice cream stand at room
temperature until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Line
8 small bowls with plastic wrap, leaving a 3-inch overhang.
Using a 2 oz. (1/4-cup) ice-cream scoop, place 1 scoop of
ice cream into the bottom of each bowl. Gently press a
maraschino cherry into the top of each ice-cream scoop, then
top each with another 2 oz. (1/4-cup) scoop of ice cream.
Working with 1 bowl of ice cream at a time, gather
overhanging plastic, wrap it up around ice cream, and gently
twist it to form a ball. Freeze until ice cream is firm and
set, about 2 hours. Place chocolate chips in a large
microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on HIGH in (30-second)
intervals, stirring thoroughly between intervals, until
melted, 3 to 4 minutes total. Whisk in coconut oil until oil
is completely melted and mixture is combined. Let cool
slightly at room temperature, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
pulse cookies and pistachios, if using, in a food processor
until finely ground, about 15 quick pulses. Transfer to a
shallow bowl, and set aside at room temperature. Working
with 1 ice-cream ball at a time, remove ice-cream ball from
freezer. Remove plastic wrap, and place ice-cream ball on a
wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Pour chocolate
mixture over ice-cream ball, allowing it to thinly coat the
top and sides. If coating in cookie mixture, quickly and
carefully invert chocolate-coated ice-cream ball into cookie
mixture, rolling until evenly coated. Transfer coated ice
cream ball to a clean wire rack set inside a large, rimmed
baking sheet in the freezer. Repeat process with remaining 7
ice-cream balls, returning to the freezer after each one.
Freeze until set, about 1 hour, or until ready to serve.

Vanilla Crème Brûlée


Ingredients
3 large egg yolks
Â¼ cup superfine sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla bean paste
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon superfine sugar

Cooking Instructions

Place egg yolks in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer on
high speed until eggs are thick and light yellow, about 5
minutes. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup sugar and vanilla bean
paste. Pour cream into the top of a double boiler over
simmering water and simmer until just hot to the touch,
about 3 minutes. Pour 1/2 of the warmed cream into the egg
mixture, a little at a time, whisking constantly so eggs do
not curdle. Pour egg yolk-cream mixture into the remaining
cream in the double boiler. Cook over medium heat, stirring
continuously, until mixture thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Do
not let mixture boil. Pour custard into 4 small ramekins and
refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours, up to 24 hours.
Sprinkle each crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e with some of the remaining
tablespoon of superfine sugar. Use a blowtorch to melt the
sugar on top of the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. It will crystallize as it
hardens. Alternatively you can use the oven broiler, but be
careful to not burn the sugar. Lightly tap the crystallized
sugar with the back of a spoon to break it before eating.

and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until just
beginning to simmer. Remove from heat, and stir in yogurt
until completely smooth and combined. Let mixture cool to
room temperature. Beat cream and vanilla together In a large
bowl until cream holds stiff peaks. Stir 1/4 of whipped
cream into cooled berry mixture, then fold berry mixture
