Air Fryer Pork Tenderloin with Sweet Potatoes


Ingredients
¼ cup olive oil, plus more for greasing
½ cup pineapple preserves
½ teaspoon granulated garlic
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
½ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper, or to taste
1 ½ pounds sweet potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 ½ pounds pork tenderloins

Cooking Instructions

Preheat air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C), if
recommended by manufacturer. Combine olive oil, pineapple
preserves, garlic granules, cayenne, salt, and white pepper
in a large mixing bowl; stir to combine. Place sweet potato
pieces into the mixing bowl and toss with the pineapple
preserves mixture. Remove sweet potatoes to a plate,
reserving the remaining pineapple mixture. Pat tenderloins
dry with paper towels. Place in the mixing bowl with the
remaining pineapple mixture and toss to coat. Brush interior
basket of the air fryer with the remaining olive oil. Place
tenderloins in the basket, and in a single layer, add as
many sweet potato pieces as will fit around the tenderloins.
Set aside extra sweet potato pieces. You will cook them as a
second batch. Air fry for 10 minutes. Turn tenderloins over,
browned side down. Stir sweet potatoes, but keep them in a
single layer. Air fry until pork loin is slightly pink in
the center, about 10 minutes longer. An instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
145 degrees F (63 degrees C). If the tenderloins need more
cooking time, turn them again and continue cooking and
testing the temperature in 5 minute increments. Remove sweet
potatoes from the air fryer when they are tender and
caramelized. (See Cook's Note). When the tenderloins test
done, place them on a platter and tent with foil. Allow to
rest while the remaining sweet potatoes cook, about 10 more
minutes.

Best Ever Cuban Sandwich


Ingredients
1/2 white onion
15 cloves garlic
3 oranges
3 limes
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 (5 pound) pork shoulder roast
1/4 cup butter, softened, divided
1 loaf Cuban bread,
2 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard
1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise
8 slices Swiss cheese
2 cups roast pork
12 ounces deli ham
12 sandwich-sliced refrigerated kosher dill pickles

Cooking Instructions

Prepare pork shoulder: Add onion, garlic, orange juice, lime
juice, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and salt into a food
processor or blender and process until smooth. Place pork in
the bottom of a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or large baking
dish and cut 3 or 4 large deep slits in the meat. Pour
marinade over pork, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator
4 hours or overnight. Place Dutch oven with prepared pork,
covered, in the oven and set the temperature to 325 degrees
F (165 degrees C). Bake until pork is very tender, 3 to 4
hours. Remove from the oven; rest 15 minutes. Remove pork to
a cutting board. Skim any fat from the cooking liquid, and
set cooking liquid aside. Shred pork with two forks, and
discard any remaining fat and bone. Return pork to the pot,
and add cooking liquid back into meat as needed to moisten.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat a
large skillet over medium heat. Spread about 2 tablespoons
softened butter over cut sides of bread and place bread,
buttered sides down, in skillet. Cook until buttered side is
lightly browned and toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir mustard
and mayonnaise together in a small bowl. Spread about 2
teaspoons mustard mixture over bottom halves of bread and
top with 1 slice of cheese, tearing as needed to fit the
bread without hanging over the edges. Using tongs or a
slotted spoon, add about 1/2 cup shredded pork to each
sandwich, draining off any excess liquid. Top each evenly
with ham, 3 pickle slices, and 1 cheese slice. Spread
remaining mustard mixture evenly over top pieces of bread
and place on top. Reheat the skillet over medium heat.
Spread about 1 tablespoon butter lightly on the outsides of
the 4 bottom buns. Working 2 sandwiches at a time, place
sandwiches, buttered side down, in skillet. Place 1 or 2
heavy-bottomed skillets on top of sandwiches to weigh them
down. Cook until toasted and lightly golden brown, 2 to 3
minutes. Remove weighted skillets. Spread remaining 1
tablespoon butter over the 4 top halves of sandwiches, flip
and press with weighted skillets again until toasted. Remove
the first 2 sandwiches from skillet; repeat the toasting
process with remaining sandwiches. Cut sandwiches in halves
and serve immediately.

Chef John's Chicken Lazone


Ingredients
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 lemon, juiced
2/3 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup green onions
1 tablespoon butter, cubed

Cooking Instructions

Mix chili powder, smoked paprika, cayenne, black pepper,
garlic powder, and onion powder together in a small bowl;
set aside. Half will be used for the chicken rub and half
for the sauce. Season chicken on both sides with salt.
Sprinkle half the spice mixture over both sides of chicken.
Wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour (or up to overnight), or
until ready to cook. Heat oil in a heavy-duty nonstick pan
over medium-high heat. Sear chicken, turning once, about 3
to 4 minutes per side; chicken will be about 75% cooked at
this point, and will finish cooking in the sauce. Turn off
heat; transfer chicken to a plate and set aside. Add
remaining spice mixture to the pan and stir around in the
hot oil for 30 seconds. Add lemon juice, cream, and water.
Stir in a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high
heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce to medium-low and return
chicken to the pan along with any accumulated juices. Simmer
gently, turning occasionally to coat with sauce, until
chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run
clear, 8 to 10 minutes. Time will vary based on size of
chicken breasts. An instant-read thermometer inserted near
the center will read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Reduce
heat to low and add green onions and butter. Stir into the
sauce, while also basting chicken with the sauce. Taste for
seasoning and serve.

Cherry Cola Ribs


Ingredients
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons mustard
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons cherry cola
1 (3 pound) rack baby back ribs, membrane removed
1 1/2 cups cherry cola
2 tablespoons ketchup
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste

Cooking Instructions

For dry rub, whisk salt, smoked paprika, onion powder,
garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a
small bowl; set aside. For wet rub, whisk mustard, vinegar,
and 2 tablespoons cherry cola together in a small bowl; set
aside. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Line a sheet pan with a piece of foil long enough to extend
past the rack of ribs by at least 6 inches on both ends. Use
large size, heavy-duty foil if possible. Place the ribs,
meat side up, on the foil. Brush wet rub over top and sides,
and sprinkle about 60% of dry rub over the surface. Turn
ribs over and, with the bone side up, brush with wet rub,
then sprinkle with all the remaining dry rub. Reserve any
wet rub left at this point. Center the ribs lengthwise on
the foil, and bring up the ends of the foil, like a boat,
and crimp so any juices will stay inside. Crimp the two long
edges together over the top of the ribs. The foil doesn’t
have to be airtight, but the whole rack should be covered.
Bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours. Remove, open the
foil, and pour off juices that have accumulated in the foil
into a saucepan. Turn the rack meat side up, and brush with
wet rub. Enclose again in the foil, and continue to roast at
250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 1 hour. While meat is
cooking, add any remaining wet rub to the juices in the
saucepan, then add the 1 1/2 cups cherry cola, ketchup, and
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a simmer
on medium high, cook until liquid is reduced by half. Reduce
heat further, and simmer liquids very slowly until they
eventually thicken and become sauce-like. Once it is the
thickness of barbecue sauce, remove from heat entirely.
After one hour at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), remove ribs
from the oven, and open out the foil, pressing foil flat to
line the pan. Turn the oven temperature up to 300 degrees F
(150 degrees C). Brush ribs with sauce. Return ribs to the
oven for 15 minutes. Repeat this process, brushing ribs with
sauce every 15 minutes, until ribs are tender and come
easily off the bone, about 1 hour more. (See Note) Let ribs
rest for about 10 minutes. Slice between each rib with a
sharp knife, and serve with extra sauce.

Grilled Tomahawk Steak


Ingredients
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon ontreal steak seasoning
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak
1/4 cup salted butter, at room temperature
1 tablespoon shallot
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chives
2 teaspoons steak rub

Cooking Instructions

To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak
seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small
airtight container; shake or stir to combine. Set aside 2
teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter. Place steak
on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and sides
with remaining steak rub until well coated. Place steak,
uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine overnight. For
compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and
the reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl. Mash
together with a fork until evenly combined. Spoon butter
into a small airtight container, cover, and refrigerate
until ready to use. Remove steak from the refrigerator 1
hour before cooking to take the chill off. It will cook on
the sheet pan that you used for dry-brining. Preheat the
oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). The reverse sear
method is used to cook this big steak, so you will need an
instant-read thermometer. If you are using a digital meat
thermometer, set the internal temperature to 110 degrees F
(43 degrees C). Bake steak on the sheet pan in the preheated
oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center reads 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), about 45 minutes.
Begin checking the temperature at 30 minutes. During the
last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time, preheat an outdoor
grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. When steak
reaches an internal temperature of 110 degrees F (43 degrees
C) measured with an instant-read thermometer, remove it from
the oven. Grill steak directly on the grates of the
preheated grill; sear on both sides, about 2 minutes per
side. This is a fatty piece of meat, so be mindful of flame
flare-ups. The internal temperature should now read 125 to
135 degrees F (51 to 57 degrees C) for medium rare. Remove
steak from the grill, and smear compound butter over top.
Let butter melt into the steak, heating up the fresh garlic,
shallots, and chives. Let steak rest for 10 minutes. Slice
steak and serve with accumulated juices and melted butter.
Be sure to serve the bone–someone will want to gnaw on it!

Hamburgers with Grilled Apple and Chili Crisp


Ingredients
2 red apples
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons chili crisp
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 (1/3-inch) slices red onion
4 hamburger buns
1/4 cup mayonnaise

Cooking Instructions

Slice 1 apple using a mandoline slicer to create 8
(1/4-inch-thick) slices. Shred any remaining scraps plus all
or part of the second apple to get 1/2 cup shredded apple.

190 degrees C)). Combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, 1
tablespoon chili crisp, salt, and the 1/2 cup shredded apple
in a bowl. Shape into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) patties, 4 inches
in diameter. Mixture may be wet so be sure to tightly pack
patties. Oil the grill grate. Grill patties, covered,
carefully turning halfway through, until an instant-read
thermometer inserted into centers of patties reads 160
degrees F (71 degrees C), 10 to 13 minutes. Grill onion
slices, turning halfway through, 8 to 10 minutes. Grill
apple slices, turning halfway through, 4 to 5 minutes. If
you like, grill buns, cut sides down, until toasted, 1 to 2
minutes. When onions are cool enough to handle, separate
rings. Stir mayonnaise and remaining 2 teaspoons chili crisp
together in a small bowl. Spread buns with mayonnaise
mixture and fill with patties, onion, and apple slices.
Serve with additional chili crisp

Hawaiian-Style Kalua Pork


Ingredients
1 4 1/2 pound) pork shoulder roast
4 teaspoons liquid hickory smoke
3 tablespoons sea salt
1 (!4 ounce) package banana leaves, thawed

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place
pork in a large bowl and rub all over with liquid smoke.
Sprinkle salt over meat, and rub in until evenly coated. Set
aside. Place banana leaves on the counter, arranging them in
a spiral, overlapping pattern, so once pork is placed on the
leaves, they can be folded up and over to fully encase the
meat. Place pork on the center of leaves, fat side down, and
wrap the meat with the seams coming together at the top.
Once wrapped, pick up and invert the entire package, seam
side down, into a Dutch oven. Any extra banana leaves can be
tucked in around the sides. Bake, covered, in the preheated
oven for about 4 hours, or an instant-read thermometer
inserted near the center reads 195 to 200 degrees F (91 to
93 degrees C). Let pork rest in the Dutch oven for 30 to 60
minutes, then remove the meat to a bowl. Pull meat off the
bone, and set bone aside. Add any and all cooking liquids
and rendered fat into the bowl of pork. Use two forks to
shred meat as finely as you like. Taste for seasoning;
adjust with more salt or liquid smoke to taste. Arrange
banana leaves in the pot to make a nest for the meat.
Transfer shredded pork in and serve immediately.

Japanese-Style Triple-Seared Steak


Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) filet mignon
1 teaspoon avocado oil
3 tablespoons sea salt
1/3 cup Japanese whiskey

is completely covered. Pour whiskey into a shallow bowl; set
aside. Place steak on hottest spot on the grill, and sear
both sides, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer steak
into bowl of whiskey, and turn constantly for at least 1
minute. Most of the salt will rinse off. Place steak back
onto the hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides
again, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. You can baste steak
with a small amount of whiskey while searing. Add soy sauce
to another shallow bowl. Add steak to the bowl, and turn
constantly for at least 1 minute. Return steak to the
hottest spot on the grill for the 3rd and final sear. Grill
both sides for about 2 1/2 minutes, or until desired
doneness is reached. For a rosy-pink inside, remove when an
instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 118
to 120 F (48 to 50 degrees C). Brush steak with melted
butter, and let rest for 3 to 4 minutes. Slice and serve
with any accumulated juices from the plate.

Lazy Hazy Beef Chili


Ingredients
2 pounds ground beef
2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon chipotle
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
12 ounces beer
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (14.5 ounce) tomatoes with green chilies
2 (16 ounce jars) extra chunky salsa
2 15 ounce) cans pinto beans, drained
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup green onions
1 cup sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup chopped cilantro

Cooking Instructions

Add beef to a dry cold pot, and turn heat to high. When beef
begins to sizzle, break up into small pieces with a potato
masher or spatula. Meat can be broken up into very fine
crumbles, or into larger chunks, depending on the desired
texture. Continue to cook and break up beef until no longer
pink, about 7 minutes. Add chili powder, chipotle, black
pepper, salt, and cinnamon to the pot. Cook, stirring, for 1
minute, then pour in beer. Stir, scraping the browned bits
from the bottom of the pot as you do. Let mixture boil until
liquid is reduced by about half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sugar,
oregano, garlic powder, diced tomatoes and jarred salsa.
Stir in; return mixture to a simmer. Stir in beans, reduce
heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until
chili is thickened and flavor is developed to your liking,
about 1 hour. Taste, adjust the seasoning. Top with sour
cream, green onions, Cheddar cheese, and cilantro as
desired.

Sous Vide Beef Tenderloin Roast


Ingredients
4 ½ pounds whole beef tenderloin
1 tablespoon sea salt/kosher salt (such as Redmonds®)
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
6 cloves garlic
3 fresh thyme sprigs, or to taste
rosemary sprig
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, or more as needed
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
1 splash red wine
1 tablespoon gelatin powder
1 cup cold water
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cooking Instructions

Trim and tie tenderloin together with kitchen twine the
night before cooking. Combine salt and pepper in a bowl and
season tenderloin on all sides. Place on a baking rack set
over a cookie sheet and allow to rest, uncovered, in the
refrigerator overnight. The next morning place tenderloin,
garlic, thyme, and rosemary into a sous vide vacuum bag and
seal using a vacuum sealer. Refrigerate until you are ready
to sous vide. Attach sous vide cooker to a heat-proof
container of water and set temperature to 133 degrees F (56
degrees C). Sous vide until tenderloin has reached the
desired temperature, 2 1/2 to 3 hours, depending on
thickness. About 30 minutes pour water in a metal bowl and
sprinkle gelatin powder on top. Allow to sit for 30 minutes
until gelatin blooms. Set on top of a double boiler over
simmering water and stir until a clear liquid forms. Do not
allow to boil. Remove tenderloin from sous vide, pat dry,
and let rest while preparing the gravy. Pour au jus liquids
from the sous vide bag into a sauce pan. Stir in 1 to 2
tablespoons butter and red wine. Add as much of the bloomed
gelatin as you like depending on desired thickness and whisk
until well combined. Season gravy with salt, pepper, and
herbs to taste. Heat cast iron pan to medium-high. Brush
tenderloin with olive oil and sear in the hot pan until
browned all over, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Melt extra butter
in the pan as desired. Remove from pan, tent with foil, and
allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Slice tenderloin and
serve with gravy.

1 cup ketchup
¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
¼ cup apple cider vinegar
¼ cup maple syrup
1 large jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon chopped canned chipotle chiles in adobo
1 tablespoon adobo sauce from canned chipotle chiles
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1 teaspoon chili powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
4 (1 1/4-inch-thick) bone-in, center cut pork chops
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)

Cooking Instructions

Prepare a thermocirculator and water bath according to
manufacturer's directions. Set thermocirculator to 135
degrees F(57 degrees C) (if you want the pork cooked medium
instead of medium-rare, set to 145 degrees F (62 degrees

together ketchup, melted butter, vinegar, maple syrup,
jalapeno, mustard, chipotles, adobo sauce, Worcestershire, 1
teaspoon salt, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder,
and smoked paprika for the sauce in a bowl. You should have
about 2 cups sauce. Season all chops evenly with remaining 1
1/2 teaspoons salt and pepper and place chops in an even
layer in a large vacuum sealable bag. Pour 1 cup of the
sauce into bag. Cover and chill remaining sauce. Massage bag
to be sure each chop is evenly coated in sauce, then seal
bag with a vacuum sealer according to manufacturer's
directions. Transfer vacuum-sealed chops to warm water bath
with thermocirculator, cover vessel with aluminum foil to
reduce evaporation. Cook 40 minutes (meat will be 135
degrees F to 145 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees C) when done
depending on desired doneness). Remove bag from water bath
and transfer meat from bag onto a rimmed baking sheet and
drizzle with canola oil. Preheat a grill or a grill pan to
medium-high (400 degrees F to 450 degrees F (200 degrees C
to 230 degrees C)). Grill meat, uncovered, until grill marks
appear, basting with 1/2 cup of the reserved sauce, 1 to 2
minutes per side. Serve chops with remaining 1/2 cup sauce

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and line a
sheet pan with foil. Slice each sweet potato in half
lengthwise, and rub cut surfaces and skins with olive oil.
Evenly sprinkle about 1 tablespoon taco seasoning all over
sweet potatoes and place on the prepared pan, cut side down.
Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then turn and
continue roasting until potatoes are fork-tender, about 15
minutes more. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium
heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until
browned and crumbly, breaking up clumps with a spatula, 5 to
8 minutes; drain excess fat. Sprinkle meat with remaining 2
tablespoons taco seasoning mix and stir in water. Simmer
until liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Place roasted
sweet potatoes on a cutting board and scoop out most of the
sweet potato flesh, leaving about 1/4-inch flesh inside the
skins. Cut the sweet potato flesh into bite-sized pieces and
stir into the ground beef mixture. Fill each sweet potato
shell with beef and sweet potato mixture, gently pressing to
fill. Place filled sweet potato skins on a serving plate and
top with taco toppings.

Tomato Basil Chicken


Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken breasts
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon talian seasoning
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 shallot, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 ( 28 can crushed tomatoes
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon chili paste
salt to taste
1/4 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped
1/2 cup half-and-half

Cooking Instructions

Cut chicken breasts in half horizontally to create cutlets.

Triple Seared Whiskey Burger


Ingredients
1 pound ground beef
2 teaspoons avocado oil
2 tablespoons sea salt
1/3 cup whiskey
1/4 cup soy sauce

Cooking Instructions

Wet your hands, and form 2 (8-ounce) burgers; place on a
plate, cover, and refrigerate until ready to grill. For this
process, cold meat works best. Before starting the triple-
searing process, build a very hot hardwood charcoal fire.
Oak, mesquite or hickory are great choices. The coals should
be glowing red, and radiating extreme heat before the meat
hits the grill. Rub burgers all over with oil. Coat with sea
salt until entire surface area is completely covered. Pour
whiskey into a shallow bowl; set aside. Place burgers on
hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides, 2 minutes
per side. Transfer burgers into bowl of whiskey, and turn
constantly for at least 1 minute. Most of the salt will
rinse off. Place burgers back onto the hottest spot on the
grill, and sear both sides again, 2 minutes per side. You
can baste steak with a small amount of whiskey while
searing. Add soy sauce to another shallow bowl. Add burgers
to the bowl, and turn constantly for at least 1 minute.
Return burgers to the hottest spot on the grill for the 3rd
and final sear. Grill each side until desired doneness is
reached, about 2 minutes. For a rosy-pink (medium-rare)
inside, remove when an instant-read thermometer inserted
near the center reads 125 to 130 F (52 to 54 degrees C).

World's Best Lasagna


Ingredients
1 pound sweet Italian sausage
¾ pound lean ground beef
½ cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
½ cup water
2 tablespoons white sugar
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves
1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
½ teaspoon fennel seeds
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
12 lasagna noodles
16 ounces ricotta cheese
1 egg
¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Cooking Instructions

Gather all your ingredients. Cook sausage, ground beef,
onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until
well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato
paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley,
basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and
pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring
occasionally. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a
boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a
mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Preheat the oven
to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). To assemble, spread 1 ½
cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping
slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top
with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups
meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup
Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining
mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent
sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure
the foil does not touch the cheese. Bake in the preheated
oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before
serving.

chicken and dumplings


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

In a large pot over medium heat, simmer chicken in 6 cups
water until no longer pink. Remove chicken, cool and shred.
Return shredded chicken to pot and stir in butter, salt and
pepper. Cook until chicken reaches desired tenderness, 15 to
60 minutes. In a bowl, stir together baking mix and milk
until smooth. In a separate bowl, stir together flour and
1/2 cup cold water until smooth. Stir flour mixture into
soup; bring soup to a rolling boil. Drop baking mix mixture
by tablespoonfuls into the boiling water, neatly around the
chicken. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, 10
minutes. Then cover and cook 10 minutes more. (Sneak a
spatula under the dumplings to prevent chicken from sticking
to the bottom of the pot.) Serve hot.

chicken fried steak


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Trim fat caps off steaks. Rub steaks with salt, then
Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. Let rest for 30 minutes.
Transfer one steak to a cutting board and cover with plastic
wrap. Use a meat mallet to pound the steak until it is about
half the original thickness and twice the original area.
Repeat with remaining two steaks. Place 2 cups flour in a
shallow bowl. Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and hot sauce together
in a second bowl. Combine remaining 3 cups flour, bread
crumbs, baking powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, onion
powder, Cajun seasoning, sea salt, chile seasoning, black
pepper, thyme, oregano, sweet paprika, chipotle powder,
cumin, sage, mustard powder, and cayenne pepper in a third,
large bowl. Dunk each piece of steak in the plain flour,
then in the egg wash, and then in the breading, making sure
it gets completely coated in each step. Transfer to a plate
and refrigerate for 1 hour; this is crucial and ensures the
breading will adhere to the meat. When ready to cook,
prepare gravy: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like
and light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Gradually whisk
beef broth into the flour mixture, then gradually whisk in
cream, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat
to low and cook, stirring occasionally, to let it further
thicken. Keep warm as you cook the steaks. Heat oil in a
deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
C). Drop steaks into the hot oil and fry until breading is
crisp and golden brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper
towel-lined plate to drain. Serve hot steaks with gravy.

1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)

Big Fat Fondant Potatoes


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon miso paste
1 1/2 teaspoons dashi powder
6 large russet potatoes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2/3 cup chicken broth

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring
chicken broth to a simmer; whisk in miso and dashi. Turn off
the heat; set aside until needed. Turn potatoes onto
narrowest side; trim straight down to create a flat surface.
Turn and trim the other side with a straight cut parallel to
the first. Cut a little off each end to square the potato a
bit more, then make 2 angled cuts on each side of the
squared ends. Transfer to a bowl of cold water. Reserve
trimmings for another use. Drain, and dry with paper towels.
Place a large cast-iron pan or other heavy ovenproof skillet
on high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil; place potatoes in
skillet with largest flat side down. Season tops with half
the salt. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook until well
browned, about 4 minutes. Turn potatoes over and repeat, to
salt and brown the other side, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat
to medium, and use a paper towel to soak up excess oil
between potatoes in the pan. Add butter, and as it melts,
baste tops of potatoes with melted butter. Once butter has
toasted to a light brown color, turn off the heat and strain
in the miso dashi broth. Roast potatoes, uncovered, in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Remove and turn
potatoes over. Add the 2/3 cup plain chicken broth, and
return to the oven to continue roasting at 425 degrees F
(220 degrees C) until potatoes can be pierced very easily
with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes more. Check occasionally to
see if broth has evaporated; add more as needed. Brush tops
of potatoes with pan drippings, and serve.

Easy Fermented Pickled Veggies


Ingredients
3 cups water
3 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 pound VEGETABLES)
1 bunch HERBS)
2 teaspoons peppercorns
3 cloves garlic,

Cooking Instructions

To sanitize jar, put a 1-quart wide-mouthed canning jar in a
6- to 8-quart pot; cover with tap water. (You could also use
multiple smaller wide-mouthed canning jars.) Bring to a
boil; boil 10 minutes. Using tongs, carefully remove jar
from pot, draining excess water; let jar cool slightly.
Meanwhile, for brine, stir together filtered water and salt
in a 1-quart measuring cup until salt is dissolved. Add
radishes (or other VEGETABLES), mint (or other HERBS),
peppercorns (or other KICK), and garlic to jar. Veggies can
be packed tightly; they will shrink and soften as they
pickle. Fill jar with brine; you may have brine left over.
Add a fermenting weight or an inverted, sanitized plastic
lid to keep vegetables submerged. Cover jar with a kitchen
towel, securing with a rubber band. Let stand at room
temperature for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days. You’ll
start to see bubbles forming. The vegetables will become
more tart and the brine will become cloudier the longer the
pickles stand. Remove fermenting weight and screw on metal
lid. Chill up to 3 weeks.

Roasted Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce


Ingredients
1 pound asparagus,
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 large egg yolks
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon water
1/2 cup butter
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
1 large hard boiled egg, peeled
1 tablespoon chives (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Place asparagus on
the prepared pan and drizzle olive oil over the spears.
Season with salt and pepper. Using clean hands, toss
asparagus spears until evenly coated with olive oil and
seasonings, then spread asparagus in a single layer on the
pan. Roast in the center of the preheated oven until fork-
tender, 10 to 12 minutes; thicker asparagus may require more
time. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, and water
together in a heavy saucepan or small skillet with a wire
whisk until well blended. Season with salt and pepper. Turn
heat to medium-low; and whisk continuously, being careful to
stir the entire bottom and sides of the pan, until eggs
begin to thicken slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. If eggs start to
curdle, remove pan from heat, and continue whisking briskly
and continuously until any lumps disappear. Gradually whisk
in hot melted butter, about a tablespoon at a time, whisking
briskly after each addition. Adjust salt and pepper, if
necessary, and stir in cayenne pepper. When whisking, each
stroke of the whisk should reveal the bottom of the pan. If
the sauce is too thick, whisk in a drop or two of water or
lemon juice. To serve, plate asparagus and pour Hollandaise
sauce on top. Grate hard-boiled egg over Hollandaise, and
garnish with snipped chives.

2 tablespoons shallots
2 tablespoons white vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
4 lime wedges

Cooking Instructions

Remove any discolored outer leaves from baby bok choy, trim
the bottom of the stalks, and slice in half lengthwise.
Bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer over medium heat in
a large pot with a steamer basket. Arrange bok choy in the
basket, cut side up. Cover; steam until stems are tender, 4
to 7 minutes, depending on the size of the stalks. To check
for tenderness, insert the tip of a knife into the stem.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium-low
heat. Add garlic and shallots, cook for about 1 minute, stir
in vinegar, and cook for 1 additional minute. Transfer bok
choy to a plate, spoon garlic mixture over the top, and
drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, and
serve with a wedge of lime.

Ultimate Lowcountry Shrimp and Grits


Ingredients
4 cups water
1 cup milk
3 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/4 cups grits
2 ears white sweet corn
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
6 slices bacon
1 onion
4 green onions, divided
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
4 ounces okra, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cloves garlic
2 tomatoes
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, or to taste (optional)
2 cups peanut oil or other vegetable oil for frying
3 large eggs
1 1/2 pounds shrimp,
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 green onions, thinly sliced
chopped parsley for garnish (optional)

Cooking Instructions

Combine water, milk, butter, and salt in a large saucepan
and bring just to a boil. Whisk in grits until incorporated.
Reduce heat to simmer, cover, and cook until thick, 25 to 30
minutes, stirring often. If mixture gets too thick, add a
little more milk or water. Cut kernels off corn cobs, and
using the back of the knife, carefully scrape the cob to
release the creamy corn milk. Stir corn kernels and corn
milk into grits and continue cooking until grits are creamy
and tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer, stirring often. Stir in
pepper and adjust seasonings if necessary. Meanwhile, heat a
large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add olive
oil and bacon slices in a single layer, and cook until bacon
is crisp, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Remove
bacon from the skillet, drain on paper towels, and set
aside. Crumble bacon once cool enough to handle. Reserve
drippings in the skillet and return skillet to medium-high
heat. Finely slice green onions and reserve green ends for
garnish. Add white parts of green onion, onion, green and
red bell peppers, and okra to the skillet and cook until
softened and lightly browned, stirring often, about 5
minutes. Add in salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne and
cook for 1 minute. Add fresh tomatoes and garlic, and cook
for 2 minutes. Add butter to mixture and allow it to melt.
Sprinkle flour over skillet and cook, stirring constantly,
about 1 minute. Add in tomatoes, with juices, and stock
while stirring constantly until smooth. Stir in sugar,
Worcestershire, and hot sauce, and return mixture to a
simmer. Cook gravy for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Heat peanut oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large,
deep skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs in a bowl;
add shrimp and stir to coat. In a shallow dish, whisk flour,
salt, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Working a
few at a time, remove shrimp from egg, allowing excess to
drip off, and lightly coat in flour mixture. Transfer shrimp
to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with
remaining shrimp. Working in batches, add shrimp to hot oil
and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned and
crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on a wire rack set over a paper
towel-lined baking sheet. To serve, place grits in the
bottom of a shallow bowl. Top with about 1/2 cup of gravy
and 6 to 8 shrimp. Top with crumbled bacon, and sprinkle
with green onions and parsley if desired.

Wet Wet Sauce


Ingredients
1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons ginger
3 tablespoons Korean chili flakes
2 teaspoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
3 tablespoons rice vinegar

Cooking Instructions

Add scallions, garlic, ginger, chili flakes, sesame seeds,
and sesame oil to a heat-safe bowl with plenty of room left
to add more ingredients. Heat neutral oil over medium-high
heat in a small saucepan until hot, about 5 minutes. Pour
hot oil carefully over green onion mixture. It will bubble
up, so pour slowly. Once the bubbling stops, stir the
mixture and allow to cool slightly. Stir in soy sauce,
oyster sauce and vinegar. Transfer mixture to a jar or
container with a tight fitting lid and refrigerate until
ready to use.

Cooking Instructions

Soak cashews in 1 1/2 cups water in a bowl until softened,
at least 20 minutes. Drain water; add almond milk. Blend
mixture in an electric blender or food processor until
smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup water, or as
needed, until sauce is slightly thinner than you want it for
the final product, as it thickens when heated. Add garlic,
nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; blend
until smooth. Pour mixture into a saucepan. Heat on medium-
low heat, stirring occasionally until heated through and
desired thickness is achieved, about 5 minutes. You can add
additional water or almond milk if sauce becomes too thick.

asparagus


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over
medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper
towel-lined plate. Crumble bacon when cool; set aside.
Reserve 1 tablespoon of bacon drippings. Melt butter with
drippings in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir
celery and onion in the saucepan until onion is translucent,
about 4 minutes. Whisk flour into the mixture and cook for 1
minute. Whisk in chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add
potato and chopped asparagus stalks, reserving the asparagus
tips for later. Season with salt and ground black pepper.
Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Pour the soup into a
blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold
down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and
carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get
the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in
batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately,
you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the
cooking pot. Cook and stir mushrooms and asparagus tips in
the same skillet used for bacon until mushrooms give up
their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and ground
black pepper, if needed. Stir mushrooms, asparagus tips, and
half-and-half cream to pureed soup. Cook until thoroughly
heated. Garnish soup with crumbled bacon.

twice baked potatoes


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). (If using a
countertop induction oven, preheat on the "Combo 3"
setting). Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high
heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10
minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into
small pieces. Toss potatoes with vegetable oil to coat;
season with salt and pepper. Spread potatoes on a baking
sheet. Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender,
about 30 minutes in the conventional oven and 20 minutes in
the countertop induction oven. Cool potatoes until easily
handled, about 5 minutes. Slice off the top 1/4 of each
potato lengthwise. Scoop flesh into a bowl using a melon
baller or small spoon, leaving about 1/8 inch of flesh on
the skin. Mash melted butter and mascarpone cheese into the
potato flesh in the bowl. Beat with a hand mixer until
fluffy, about 30 seconds. Stir in bacon, green onions, and
Cheddar cheese. Fill potato skins with potato mixture;
return to the baking sheet. Bake filled potatoes in the
preheated oven until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Turn
on the oven's broiler; broil potatoes until cheese is bubbly
and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the oven. Season
shrimp with Creole seasoning; transfer to a grill pan. Grill
shrimp over high heat until opaque, about 3 minutes. (If
using a countertop induction oven, cook shrimp on the "Grill
setting" until opaque, about 3 minutes.) Top each potato
with 1 shrimp.

Air Fryer Cinnamon Roll Bites


Ingredients
1 (12.4 ounce) cinnamon rolls
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon orange peel
1 tablespoon orange juice
icing

Cooking Instructions

Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Add sugar and
cinnamon to a large resealable plastic bag, and shake to
combine. Remove the 8 cinnamon rolls from the can, and set
icing aside. Cut each roll into 4 equal pieces for a total
of 32 bites. Line the fryer basket with parchment paper.
Place the bites in a single layer in the bottom of the
basket, cook for 3 minutes, turn over using tongs, and cook
until golden brown, another 2 to 3 minutes. Depending on the
brand and size of your air fryer, you may have to cook in
batches, and your timing may vary, so watch closely.
Meanwhile, prepare the dip. Add cream cheese, confectioner’s
sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and the packaged icing to
a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed
until you reach a dipping consistency, about 1 minute. Drop
the warm pieces into the sugar-cinnamon mixture, and shake.
Transfer to a plate or basket, and serve with the dip.

Banana Bread Brownies


Ingredients
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 ounces dark chocolate, broken into pieces
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 large egg
2 bananas, mashed (about 1 cup)
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
12 slices banana (optional)
2 tablespoons white sugar

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Generously butter a 9x9-inch square pan. A piece of
parchment paper can also be added to the bottom of the pan
to prevent sticking. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Melt chocolate
in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second
intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an
electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg, vanilla, and
mashed banana, and beat until combined. Add chocolate, and
beat until mixture is well combined and smooth. Use a
spatula to mix in walnuts and chocolate chips, then use the
spatula to mix in flour just until flour disappears.
Transfer batter into the prepared pan and smooth top. Place
banana slices on top, evenly spaced in a grid pattern. Bake
in the preheated oven until a skewer comes out almost clean
but with some batter on the very tip. If you want fudgier
brownies, do not overcook. Let brownies cool in the pan.
Cover, refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour, and serve
chilled. For optional banana brûlée: While brownies are
cooling, cover each banana slice with a half teaspoon of
sugar. Use a propane kitchen torch to melt the sugar until
dark brown and bubbling. Be careful not to char the edges of
the crust around the banana too much. This banana brûlée
step can also be done before the brownies go into the oven.

Classic Biscuits


Ingredients
2 1/4 cups flour, plus more for rolling
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon sea salt
8 tablespoons) butter
3/4 cup yogurt
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large
baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together flour,
baking powder, baking soda, and fine sea salt in a large
bowl. Coat whole stick of butter in flour mixture. Grate
butter on the large holes of a box grater into bowl. (If

and continue grating.) Use your fingers to toss butter in
flour mixture until all butter pieces are separated and
coated in flour. (Mixture should resemble coarse crumbs.)
Whisk together yogurt and water in a small bowl; add to
flour mixture. Gently fold to bring dough together. Dough
should be moistened but still crumbly. If dough is too dry,
add more cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until fully
moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work
surface. Lightly knead three or four times until dough comes
together. Sprinkle with flour; pat to 3/4-inch thickness.
Cut dough into four equal portions. Stack portions, press
down, and pat again to form a 3/4-inch-thick rectangle.
Repeat process three times, adding flour as needed. Press a
2 1/2- to 3-inch biscuit cutter straight down into dough to
cut out biscuits. Gently knead scraps together, pat to
3/4-inch thickness, and repeat cutting. Arrange on prepared
baking sheet (biscuits should be barely touching). Bake in
the preheated oven until tops are crisp and golden brown, 15
to 16 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet 5 minutes. Brush
tops with melted butter and sprinkle with flaky salt. (Store
in an airtight container up to 3 days; chill up to 1 week.

Classic Glazed Doughnuts


Ingredients
⅓ cup milk
⅓ cup cake flour
1 cup milk
4 ¼ cups cake flour, plus more for dusting
1 package active dry yeast
5 ounces evaporated milk
½ cup butter, melted and cooled
2 large eggs
¼ cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups vegetable oil for frying
3 cups powdered sugar
½ cup melted butter
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
⅛ teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons hot water

Cooking Instructions

For tangzhong, whisk together 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup cake
flour in a small saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, over
medium heat until a very thick paste forms, about 3 minutes
(watch constantly—it thickens quickly). Cool briefly. Heat 1
cup milk in a second saucepan to 105 degrees F to 115
degrees F (40 degrees C to 46 degrees C). Transfer warm milk
to the bowl of a stand mixer; stir in yeast and let stand
for 5 minutes. Add evaporated milk, melted butter, eggs,
sugar, salt, vanilla, the cooled tangzhong, and 2 cups cake
flour to the stand mixer. Using the paddle attachment, beat
at low speed until mixture is smooth, about 3 minutes.
Gradually beat in remaining 2 1/4 cups cake flour to make a
soft dough. Continue beating at low speed until dough is
smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Dough will be soft. Turn dough out
onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth, 2
to 3 minutes, adding 2 to 4 tablespoons additional cake
flour. Be careful not to add too much flour. (If dough
begins to stick to surface, use a bench scraper to lift
dough from surface and add a dusting of flour. If your dough
is too soft to knead, chill covered for 2 hours or up to
overnight before kneading.) Shape dough into a ball.
Transfer to a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease
surface; cover. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in
size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough and turn out onto
floured surface. Roll dough into a 10x15-inch rectangle
about 1/2-inch thick. If dough springs back, let it rest an
additional 10 minutes. Lightly flour 2 large baking sheets.
Cut dough using 3-inch and 1-inch round cutters to create
doughnuts and doughnut holes. Arrange cutouts 1 inch apart
on the prepared baking sheets. Cover with a towel and let
cutouts rise in a warm place until very light and fluffy,
about 1 hour. [If you have scraps, gently knead together,
being careful not to overwork dough; let rest 10 minutes
before cutting.] Arrange wire racks in two 10x15-inch rimmed
baking pans (one for cooling, one for finished glazed
doughnuts). About 20 minutes before doughnuts are done
rising, pour oil to a depth of 2 1/2 to 3 inches into a
large skillet or a deep-fat fryer. Heat to 365 degrees F
(185 degrees C). Working in batches of 2 to 3 doughnuts,
fry, turning once halfway through, until golden, about 90
seconds. Transfer to prepared cooling rack to cool slightly.
Repeat with remaining doughnuts. For doughnut holes, working
in batches, fry, constantly moving with a slotted spoon,
until evenly golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to prepared
rack to cool slightly. Whisk together powdered sugar, melted
butter, vanilla extract and salt in a bowl to make the
vanilla glaze. Whisk in hot water, 1 tablespoon at a time,
until desired consistency. If glaze thickens, stir in
additional hot water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Dip warm
doughnuts and doughnut holes into vanilla glaze, turning to
coat both sides. Arrange doughnuts on the second prepared
rack to allow glaze to set, about 30 minutes.

Copycat Texas Roadhouse Rolls


Ingredients
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 oz. dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg yolk
2 large eggs
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
cooking spray
1 tablespoon water
cinnamon Honey Butter

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Heat milk in a small saucepan over
medium heat, stirring occasionally, until just bubbling
around the edges, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour
into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook
attachment. Stir in sugar and 4 tablespoons butter; let
cool, stirring occasionally, until mixture is between 110
degrees F and 120 degrees F (43 degrees C and 48 degrees C)
about 10 minutes. Stir in yeast; let stand until mixture is
foamy, about 10 minutes. Add salt, egg yolk, 1 egg, and 1/2
of the flour; beat on low speed until combined, about 1
minute. Still on low speed, carefully add remaining flour,
1/2 cup at a time, and beat until dough just comes together,
about 1 minute. Dough will be very sticky and wet. Increase
speed to medium, and beat until dough pulls away from sides
of bowl and dough is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.
Coat a large bowl with cooking spray; transfer dough to
prepared bowl. Cover loosely and let rise in a warm place
until about doubled in size, about 1 hour. With a clean
hand, punch down dough and turn dough out onto a lightly
floured work surface. Press or roll dough out into a
rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Trim edges with a sharp
knife to create a perfect 16- x 8-inch rectangle. Starting
at one long end, fold dough in half to form a 16- x 4-inch
rectangle; pinch to close dough halves together. Use a sharp
knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into 16 (2-inch) squares.
Place dough squares onto a parchment paper-lined baking
sheet about 1/2-inch apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap;
set aside at room temperature until about doubled in size, 1
hour. (It’s okay if the baking sheet looks a little
crowded.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk together remaining egg and water until combined. Brush
tops of rolls with egg wash. Bake in preheated oven until
golden brown, 12 to 16 minutes. Microwave remaining 2
tablespoons butter on HIGH until melted, about 30 seconds.
Immediately brush rolls with melted butter. Serve warm with
Cinnamon Honey Butter.

Flatbreads with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce


Ingredients
4 large red bell peppers
1/3 cup slivered almonds, toasted
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, plus leaves for garnish
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, smashed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 14.1 ounce) package flatbreads
2 cups shredded fontina cheese
1 cup shredded cooked chicken
1/2 cup kalamata and/or green olives
black pepper, for garnish

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line 2
(10x15-inch) rimmed baking sheets with foil. Arrange half of
the peppers, cut sides down, on each prepared baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until skin is blistered and
charred, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer peppers to a large bowl.
Cover with plastic wrap or a tea towel; let stand until cool
enough to handle, 20 to 30 minutes. Peel and discard skins.
You should have about 2 cups roasted peppers. Reduce oven
temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). For sauce,
blend roasted peppers, almonds, oil, chopped basil, lemon
juice, garlic, and salt in a blender or food processor until
smooth. Remove and discard foil from baking sheets. Arrange
1 flatbread on each baking sheet. Spread each flatbread with
1/2 cup sauce, spreading to 1/2 inch from edges. Reserve
remaining sauce for another use. Top evenly with cheese,
chicken, and olives. Bake until cheese is melted and edges
are browned, 8 to 9 minutes. For a crispier crust, bake
topped flatbreads 6 to 7 minutes directly on oven rack
instead of on baking sheets. Garnish with black pepper and
additional basil. Cut each flatbread into 6 slices.

use before the autolyse has gone a full 2 hours, proceed
with mixing dough anyway. Mix the dough: Weigh out 70g
levain, and add to the top of the autolyse mixture of flour
and water. Sprinkle salt around the edges. With damp hands,
pull up and fold dough from edges to the middle, turning the
bowl as you fold, until completely mixed. Cover; let rest
for 15 minutes. Cover and return the excess levain to the
refrigerator to use for a future batch of bread. Perform
first set of folds: Lift dough with wet hands at the edge
and flop to the middle; turn the bowl a few inches and
continue to flop and turn until dough begins to resist being
pulled to the center. Repeat folds twice more, 15 minutes
apart, covering dough in between. Set a timer for 30
minutes. Now turn dough out onto counter, and perform the
first stretch and fold. Stretch the dough into a rough
12-inch square. Pull 2 corners and fold the dough into
thirds; then fold the top half to the bottom. Roll the dough
forward, then form into a ball with a flat bench scraper;
return dough to the bowl and cover. Repeat the stretch and
fold process 2 more times, 30 minutes apart. Cover; let
dough bulk ferment until very bubbly and doubled in size, 4
to 5 hours. Turn dough out onto counter, and pre-shape dough
into a ball. Dust with flour, and let rest on the counter 30
minutes. Perform the final shaping: Dust the counter with
flour, and gently flop the dough over into the flour with
the bench scraper. Again, perform a stretch and fold, but
gently, to not deflate the dough. Shape into as high and
round a ball as possible using the bench scraper. Dust the
top with flour. Generously dust a banneton with rice flour,
Carefully slide the bench scraper under the dough, and turn
it over into the banneton. Now, and this is optional,
"stitch" the dough by bringing opposite pieces of the dough
up, sticking them together in the center. Dust with a little
flour. Cover; proof dough in the refrigerator for 14 hours.
One hour before baking, place the pan you will bake the
bread in, or a pizza stone, in the oven. and heat the oven
to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). After 1 hour of
preheating, turn dough out of banneton onto parchment, and
score 1/4-inch deep with a razor or sharp thin knife. Place
in bread pan, add 2 ice cubes to the pan; cover. Bake for 20
minutes at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Remove cover,
lower the heat to 450 degrees F (240 degrees C), and bake an
additional 35 minutes, or until desired doneness. Let cool 1
hour before slicing.

Iced Dried Cherry Biscuits


Ingredients
2 1/4 cups flour, plus more for rolling
3/4 cup dried cherries
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons orange zest, plus more for garnish
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon sea salt
stick (8 tablespoons) butter
3/4 cup Greek-style yogurt
1/2 cup orange juice, or more as needed
1 cup sifted powdered sugar
5 teaspoons whole milk
1/8 teaspoon sea salt

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C). Line a
large baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together
flour, dried cherries, sugar, baking powder, orange zest,
baking soda, and fine sea salt in a large bowl. Coat whole
stick of butter in the flour mixture. Grate butter on the
large holes of a box grater into bowl. If butter starts to
melt, coat butter in flour mixture again and continue
grating. Use your fingers to toss butter in flour mixture
until all butter pieces are separated and coated in flour.
Mixture should resemble coarse crumbs. Whisk together yogurt
and orange juice in a small bowl; add to flour mixture.
Gently fold to bring dough together. Dough should be
moistened but still crumbly. If dough is too dry, add more
cold orange juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, until fully
moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work
surface. Lightly knead three or four times until dough comes
together. Sprinkle with flour; pat to 3/4 inch thickness.
Cut dough into four equal portions. Stack portions, press
down, and pat again to form a 3/4-inch-thick rectangle.
Repeat process three times, adding flour as needed. Press a
2 1/2- to 3-inch biscuit cutter straight down into dough to
cut out biscuits. Gently knead scraps together, pat to
3/4-inch thickness, and repeat cutting. Arrange on prepared
baking sheet (biscuits should be barely touching). Bake
until tops are crisp and golden brown, 15 to 16 minutes. Let
cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Stir together
powdered sugar, milk, and 1/8 teaspoon sea salt in a bowl
until icing is well combined. Drizzle biscuits with icing;
garnish with more orange zest. Store in an airtight
container up to 3 days; chill up to 1 week. To reheat, bake
about 10 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Sausage Gravy Kolaches


Ingredients
1/2 cup milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
1 package dry yeast
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 large egg
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour, plus more as needed
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
8 ounces ground pork breakfast sausage (or sausage links with casings removed)
1 1/2 teaspoons all purpose flour
4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
4 green onions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish
2 tablespoons milk
2 sage leaves, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne
1 large egg, beaten, divided

Cooking Instructions

Combine warm milk, yeast, sugar, salt, and melted butter in
the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attached. Add
egg and flour. Drop down dough hook and start kneading on
low speed, stopping and scraping down the sides every so
often in the beginning to make sure all the ingredients are
incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Once everything has come
together, increase speed 1 notch and continue kneading until
dough is very soft, very smooth, and slightly elastic, about
2 minutes. Transfer dough onto a work surface, knead for 1
minute, and shape into a smooth ball. Since the dough has
butter in it, it won’t be sticky. Return dough ball to a
lightly buttered bowl. Cover, and allow to rise in a warm
spot until it has doubled in size, about 90 minutes. Once
dough is risen, transfer to a work surface and punch down to
de-gas. Shape back into a ball, and weigh on a digital
scale. Divide amount by 8 and weigh out 8 equal dough
portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball, using just
enough flour to keep it from sticking. Press and flatten the
dough into a disc about 3 1/2-inches wide and a 1/2-inch
thick. Shape with your hands to make a small indention in
the middle. Transfer to a silpat-lined baking sheet. Cover
and let proof until almost doubles in size, 45 to 60
minutes. Combine cooled sausage, cream cheese, green onions,
milk, sage, ½ of the beaten egg, salt, pepper, and cayenne
in a bowl. Mix filling into a thick paste with a spoon.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) Use
slightly damp fingertips to press a well into the center of
each kolache to place the filling. Be sure to leave no more
that 3/4-inch of un-pressed dough around the outside. Do not
press all the way through the dough to the baking sheet.
Brush each kolache with remaining egg wash. Fill evenly with
the sausage cream cheese mixture. Bake in the preheated oven
until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven,
transfer to a wire rack, and allow to rest for 10 to 15
minutes before serving. Top with sliced green onions for
garnish.

Sour Cream Donuts


Ingredients
2 ¼ cups bleached cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
¾ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
⅔ cup sour cream, room temperature
½ cup granulated sugar
2 large egg yolks, room temperature
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
vegetable oil as needed for frying
4 ½ cups powdered sugar
½ cup unsalted butter, melted
6 tablespoons hot water
1 ½ teaspoons light corn syrup
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon
together in a bowl until well combined. Whisk sour cream,
granulated sugar, egg yolks, melted butter, oil, and vanilla
together in a large bowl until well combined. Gradually fold
flour mixture into sour cream mixture just until combined.
(Dough will be quite soft and sticky.) Cover, and chill in
the refrigerator until dough is cold and just slightly
firmed, about 2 hours. Turn dough out onto a heavily-floured
surface and pat or roll to 3/8- to 1/2-inch thickness,
flouring hands or rolling pin as needed. Cut dough using a
floured 3 ½-inch round cutter. Cut holes in the center of
the dough circles using a floured 1 ¼-inch round cutter.
Transfer dough rings to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Reroll, and cut dough scraps, repeating process as needed.
Heat 3 inches of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat
until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F to 365
degrees F (182 degrees C to 185 degrees C). Fry 1 to 2
donuts at a time until golden brown and cooked through,
about 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side, adjusting heat as necessary
to maintain oil temperature. Transfer donuts to a baking
sheet lined with paper towels using a spider strainer. Let
drain, and cool for 5 minutes (see note). Whisk together
powdered sugar, melted butter, hot water, corn syrup, salt,
and vanilla in a large bowl for the glaze until smooth and
well combined. Place 1 warm donut in the powdered sugar
mixture, craggy side up; use a spoon to coat donut
completely in the glaze. Remove donut from glaze using two
forks placed underneath; let excess drip off, and then
transfer donut to a wire rack placed over a rimmed baking
sheet. Repeat with remaining donuts and glaze. Let donuts
stand until glaze is set before serving, about 25 minutes.

Triple Coffee Sweet Rolls


Ingredients
1/4 cup espresso powder
2 cups milk,
2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon espresso powder
1 tablespoon cocoa
1 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar
3 tablespoons espresso or strong coffee, or more as needed

Cooking Instructions

Combine 1/4 cup instant espresso and hot milk in the bowl of
a stand mixer, and let cool until just warm to the touch,
about 95 degrees F (35 degrees C). Add yeast, egg, white
sugar, salt, and 6 tablespoons melted butter. Add most of
the flour, attach the dough hook, and knead on low speed
until everything comes together and begins to pull away from
the sides of the bowl. Turn mixer speed up a notch, and
continue to knead until a smooth, soft, elastic dough forms,
adding in remaining flour as needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove
dough from the mixer, form into a ball, and place back in
the bowl. Cover and let it rise in a warm place until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, make filling. Melt
1/2 cup butter in a small pan over medium heat. Stir in
brown sugar, cocoa, and 1 tablespoon instant espresso
powder. Once combined, remove from heat and let cool. As
soon as butter starts to cool and solidify, stir to form a
thick, spreadable paste. Reserve until needed. Once dough
has risen, use your hands to press out the air, and reshape
into a ball. For best results, transfer dough to a plastic
bag and place in the refrigerator overnight. Dough can be
used right away if need be. Very lightly flour a work
surface. Turn dough out onto the work surface, press into a
rectangle, and very lightly dust the top with flour. Roll
out into a 12x18-inch rectangle. Spread filling evenly to
the edges, leaving a few inches along one of the long sides
free of filling. Lightly brush exposed dough with water;
this will help to seal the seam. Beginning with the long
side that has filling, roll dough and filling toward the
long side with exposed dough to form a uniform log,
finishing with the seam on the bottom. Generously butter a
9x12- or 13-inch baking dish or pan, and, if desired, line
the bottom with buttered parchment. Score the log of dough
into 12 equal portions, and then cut each portion with a
piece of string as shown. Place cut rolls into the prepared
pan. Cover rolls and leave to rise in a warm spot until
doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375
degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until
puffed, golden brown at the edges, and an instant-read
thermometer inserted into the center, reads 200 degrees F
(95 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes
before icing. Whisk together confectioner’s sugar with 3 to
4 tablespoons of espresso or strong coffee, or enough to
form an icing that can be drizzled over with a spoon.
Drizzle icing over rolls and let cool before serving, or
enjoy slightly warm.

Roasted Butternut Squash Salad


Ingredients
1 medium butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
6 slices bacon
1 cup sliced onion
8 cups chopped romaine lettuce
⅓ cup pecans, toasted and chopped
⅓ cup raisins
2 tablespoons maple syrup, or to taste

crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove bacon and drain on paper
towels. Add onions to the skillet and cook in the bacon
grease for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 8 cups squash and cook,

Air Fryer Spinach


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Make filling: Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium
heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3
minutes. Add bell pepper and mushrooms; cook, stirring
occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Remove from
heat and stir in spinach and garlic; continue stirring until
spinach is slightly wilted. Season with Italian seasoning,
salt, and pepper. Let cool for 10 minutes. Stir in feta
cheese, breaking up any large pieces. Prepare chicken: Pat
chicken dry and place on a cutting board. Cut a pocket in
each breast by inserting a knife into the thickest part of
the breast and slicing parallel to the cutting board,
leaving about 1 inch at each tip. Be careful not to cut all
the way through the thinnest edge of the breast. Preheat an
air fryer to 370 degrees F (190 degrees C) if preheating is
recommended by the manufacturer. Separate prosciutto slices
and place onto a clean surface. Place 2 tablespoons filling
onto each slice; roll prosciutto around filling to create an
oblong bundle. Tuck one bundle into each sliced chicken
breast and close the opening with a few toothpicks. Place
beaten egg into a shallow bowl. Combine Parmesan cheese,
bread crumbs, parsley, salt, and pepper in another shallow
bowl. Dip each stuffed chicken breast into beaten egg, then
dredge in bread crumb mixture. Spray both sides with cooking
spray and place into the air fryer basket. Cook chicken in
the preheated air fryer until browned, about 15 minutes per
side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
of meat should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 2 large ramekins or
heatproof bowls with cooking spray, and press one tortilla
inside each bowl with the edges coming up and out. Crack 2
eggs into each tortilla shell, then top each with 1/4 cup
cheese. Sprinkle each with 1/8 teaspoon adobo seasoning and
1/8 teaspoon salt. Working with one tortilla bowl at a time,
cook in the air fryer until tortillas are crispy, egg whites
are set, and yolks are runny, 13 to 15 minutes. While
tortillas cook, stir together cherry tomatoes, cilantro,
scallions, lime juice, remaining 1/2 teaspoon adobo
seasoning, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl.
Break bacon into small pieces, and set aside. Remove
tortillas from bowls and place on a plate. Top bowls evenly
with tomato mixture, avocado, and bacon.

Chef Johns Tortilla de Patatas


Ingredients
2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or russet potatoes, peeled
1 yellow onion
5 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 cup olive oil

Cooking Instructions

Slice potatoes and onions with a very sharp knife or
mandoline into 1/8-inch thick slices. Combine eggs, 1/2
teaspoon salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl and
whisk very thoroughly; set aside. Add 1/3 cup olive oil to a
large nonstick pan and set heat to medium-high. Add
potatoes, onions, and remaining salt. Cook, tossing and
stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, and some
onions and potatoes are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
Between stirrings, cover potatoes to reduce cooking time and
keep in moisture. For less browning, reduce heat to medium.
Stir potato mixture into egg mixture with a spatula. Cover
and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Add remaining olive oil
to an 8- or 9-inch nonstick pan, and set the pan over
medium-high heat. Pour in egg and potato mixture, and smooth
the top. Cook, covered, for about 4 minutes or until the
bottom is browned and the edges of tortilla begin to firm
up. Slide tortilla out onto a plate, cover with another
plate, and flip the plates over to invert. Slide tortilla
back into the pan, and place back over medium-high heat.
Cook, uncovered, until the tortilla is fully set, about 2
minutes more. Tortilla will spring back lightly when pressed
in the middle with a finger if eggs are fully cooked. If it
feels soft or mushy when pressed, cook for a few minutes
more, unless you prefer the tortilla less than fully set.
Slip tortilla onto a serving plate, and serve hot, warm, or
room temperature.

Cinnamon Roll Focaccia


Ingredients
1/4 cup canola oil,
all-purpose flour
2 (1-pound) pizza dough
1/4 cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
7 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 ounces cream cheese
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon whole milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Evenly coat a 13- x 9-inch baking
pan with 1/4 cup of the oil. On a lightly floured work
surface, using your hands or a rolling pin, press dough
balls into about 1-inch thickness. Stir together 2
tablespoons light brown sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a

sugar mixture, place second dough round on top, and knead
together until combined and one ball of dough is formed.
Place dough in the prepared pan, cover with plastic wrap,
and let rest in a warm place for 3 hours, removing plastic
every hour and gently pressing out dough as thin as
possible. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Uncover dough, and spread into an even layer pressing into
the edges of the pan. Grease your hands and make deep
dimples all over the top of the dough with your fingertips.
Drizzle evenly with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and make
dimples all over top of the dough with your fingertips
again. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly risen and
starting to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt 6
tablespoons of the butter in a small saucepan over medium.
Remove from heat, add remaining 1/4 cup light brown sugar
and remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and stir until combined;
drizzle evenly over dough. Return to oven and bake at 450
degrees F (230 degrees C) until well browned and puffed, 8
to 10 more minutes. Meanwhile, combine cream cheese and
remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a bowl and beat on medium
speed with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, about
30 seconds. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating at low
speed until blended, about 30 seconds. Stir in milk and
vanilla until icing is smooth and creamy. Drizzle icing over
hot bread; serve warm.

Crescent Breakfast Squares


Ingredients
2 12x16-inch parchment paper sheets
2 (12 ounce) packages crescent roll dough (such as Pillsbury® Grands!™)
8 slices deli ham
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or more to taste
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
½ cup diced onion
½ cup diced red bell pepper
10 large eggs
1 tablespoon half-and-half cream or heavy whipping cream
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
8 slices Swiss cheese
1 tablespoon bagel seasoning (such as Trader Joe's® Everything But the Bagel Seasoning Blend)

Cooking Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread each
sheet of parchment on a work surface. Unroll crescent dough,
and place the contents of one can on each sheet. Roll dough
into two 10x15-inch rectangles, making sure the perforations
are sealed, one rectangle per parchment. Slide one dough
rectangle with its parchment paper onto a 13x18-inch sheet
pan; reserve the second rectangle for later use. Working
with the first piece of dough, spread ham slices over the
dough, leaving about 1/2-inch on all sides. Spread Dijon
mustard in a thin layer over the ham slices. Melt 1
tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook
and stir onions and bell peppers until slightly softened,
about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low; add 1 tablespoon
butter to skillet with vegetables until melted. Whisk eggs,
half-and-half or cream, salt, and pepper together in a large
bowl until well blended. Pour egg mixture into the skillet
with vegetables. Cook, using a spatula to lift and move,
until eggs are just set and still wet looking. Spoon lightly
cooked egg mixture in an even layer over the ham slices,
maintaining the 1/2-inch dough border all around. Place
sliced Swiss cheese in a single layer over the eggs. Place
the second dough rectangle over all, using the parchment to
help you align it. Carefully peel off the parchment. Moisten
fingertips and press the edges of the two dough rectangles
together, then use a fork to crimp. Melt remaining 1
tablespoon butter; brush over the top of the dough with a
pastry brush. Sprinkle bagel seasoning over all. Bake in the
preheated oven until nicely browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove to cool on a wire rack for about 15 minutes. Slice
into serving pieces with a sharp knife.

1 large zucchini, grated and squeezed dry
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
4 large eggs
4 ounces halloumi cheese, sliced

1 cup cheesecake filling, such as Philadelphia® Cheesecake No-Bak
1/4 cup lemon curd
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water

croissant. Create an opening large enough to pipe the
filling into. Fill each roll with about 3 tablespoons of
filling. Place filled croissants on a wire rack set inside a
lined baking sheet to catch excess drippings. Add sugar and
water to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-
high heat. Reduce to medium low and cook, without stirring,
until lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove mixture
from the heat. Working very carefully, pour sugar syrup
evenly over prepared croissants to lightly coat rolls; let
stand until completely cooled and lightly hardened on top,
10 to 15 minutes.

2 large eggs
1 pinch salt
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon water
salt to taste
2 tablespoons unsalted butter,

and a little runny, 20 to 25 minutes. The eggs will continue
to cook and set more firmly once removed from the oven if
left in the hot ramekins. When eggs have 10 minutes cook
time remaining, make lemon butter sauce. Add lemon juice,
water, and salt to a small pan. Bring to a simmer over
medium heat, and simmer until liquid has reduced by about
half, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to lowest setting and add
butter slices. Start swirling and shaking the pan until
butter is almost fully emulsified, then turn off the heat.
Continue swirling pan until butter is entirely melted.
Taste; add cayenne or hot sauce if using. Keep pan in a warm
spot until needed. Sauce will thicken slightly as it cools

Strawberry Rhubarb Drop Biscuits


Ingredients
1 1/4 cups rhubarb
1 1/4 cups strawberries
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stick unsalted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons fruit syrup
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 large egg (optional)
2 teaspoons water (optional)
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Cooking Instructions

Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into
1/4-inch pieces; place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries
and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss to combine, cover, and let
fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Combine
flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing
bowl; whisk to combine. Drain fruit in a strainer set over a
bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices that pass through. Grate
frozen butter into the flour mixture, while stirring with a
fork several times to coat butter pieces with flour. Add 1/4
cup sugar, and drained fruit, mixing with a fork until fruit
is coated with flour. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved
fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk. Mix with a fork just
until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough.
If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little
more buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a
little more flour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230
degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat. Scoop or
spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking
sheet. Whisk together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush
biscuits with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in the
preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack
and let cool completely. Mix powdered sugar, lemon zest, and
lemon juice together in a small bowl for the lemon icing.
Fill icing into a piping bag or a plastic bag with the tip
cut off and drizzle icing over cooled biscuits.

omelets


Ingredients

Cooking Instructions

Add eggs to a bowl, along with water, soy sauce, mirin,
salt, sugar, and cayenne. Use a fork to beat eggs until
whites are completely incorporated. Transfer egg mixture
into a pourable measuring cup. Set a 10-inch non-stick pan
over medium heat. Mix sesame and vegetable oil in a small
bowl, and use a brush to oil the pan. Pour in 1/3 of egg
mixture. Tilt the pan to cover the bottom with eggs. Cook
until omelet is about halfway set, then use a spatula to
turn over about 1 inch of edge toward the center on 3 sides
to square the shape on those 3 sides. If eggs seem to be
cooking too fast, reduce heat to medium-low. Use a spatula
to roll the omelet toward the rounder side, to form a
rectangular roll, about 2 inches wide by 8 inches long.
Slide omelet over to about 3 inches from the edge of the
pan, and brush more oil over the pan surface. Pour the
second 1/3 of eggs around the omelet. Lift omelet slightly
with the spatula so that some eggs flow underneath. Raise
heat back to medium, if it was reduced. When egg layer is
halfway set, use a spatula to roll this layer up and over
the already-folded omelet in the pan, and continue to roll
into a rectangle. Add remaining 1/3 of egg mixture, and
repeat cooking and rolling steps to make the final layer.
Transfer omelet onto plastic wrap, and use it to shape the
omelet, before wrapping and rolling it into a tight package;
cover with a towel and let rest for 5 minutes. Unwrap, slice
into 6 or 8 pieces, and serve on a warm plate. Sprinkle with
furikake.

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix
chicken, red bell pepper, spinach, Cheddar cheese,
mayonnaise, lemon zest, salt, and nutmeg together in a large
bowl. Set aside. Unroll crescent roll dough, and separate
into 16 triangles. Arrange triangles in a circle on a
13-inch baking stone or pizza pan with the wide ends of the
triangles overlapping in the center and points facing out.
The center diameter should be about 5-inches. Scoop chicken
mixture evenly onto the widest end of each triangle. Bring
the outer point of each triangle towards the center of the
circle and tuck the point under the wide end of the dough.
The filling will not be completely covered. Bake in the
preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Slice
and serve.

Chocolate-Glazed Hazelnut Mousse Cake


Ingredients
2 tablespoons hazelnuts, toasted and skins rubbed off
3 tablespoons sugar
½ cup all-purpose flour
¼ cup unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
⅛ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
3 tablespoons cold water
½ cup chocolate hazelnut spread such as Nutella
½ cup mascarpone
1 ½ cups chilled heavy cream
2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
3 tablespoons sugar
5 tablespoons heavy cream
3 ½ ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), chopped

Cooking Instructions

For shortbread base: Put oven rack in middle position and
preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Invert bottom of springform
pan (to make it easier to slide shortbread base off bottom),
then lock on side of pan and line bottom with a round of
parchment paper. Pulse hazelnuts with sugar in a food
processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add flour, butter,
cocoa, and salt and pulse just until a dough forms. Press
dough evenly onto bottom of springform pan with your
fingers. Prick all over with a fork, then bake until just
dry to the touch, about 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer base in
pan to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Remove
side of pan and carefully slide out parchment from under
shortbread, then reattach side of pan around shortbread
base. Make mousse while shortbread cools: Sprinkle gelatin
over water in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan and let
stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Heat gelatin mixture
over low heat, stirring, just until gelatin is melted, about
2 minutes. Whisk in chocolate hazelnut spread until combined
and remove from heat. Whisk together mascarpone and
chocolate hazelnut mixture in a large bowl. Beat together
cream, cocoa powder, and sugar in another large bowl with an
electric mixer at low speed until just combined, then
increase speed to high and beat until cream just holds soft
peaks. Whisk one third of whipped cream into mascarpone
mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whipped cream
until well combined. Spoon filling onto shortbread base in
pan, gently smoothing top, then chill, covered, at least 3
hours. Make ganache and glaze cake: Bring cream to a simmer
in a small heavy saucepan and remove from heat. Add
chocolate and let stand 1 minute, then gently whisk until
completely melted and smooth. Transfer ganache to a small
bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until slightly
thickened but still pourable, about 20 minutes. Run a warm
thin knife around inside of springform pan, then remove
side. Slide cake off bottom of pan and transfer to a serving
plate. Pour ganache onto top of cake and spread, allowing
excess ganache to drip down sides.

Cinnamon Streusel Coffee Cake


Ingredients
¾ cup brown sugar
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
½ cup unsalted butter, softened
3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
1 ½ cups white sugar
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
3 large eggs
¾ cup milk
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease a 9x13-inch baking dish; set aside. To make the

vanilla and beat for 30 seconds. Pour 1/2 of the batter into
the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the cinnamon layer over

Espresso Bundt Cake


Ingredients
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 1/2 tablespoons espresso powder
1 3/4 cups cake flour
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 3/4 cups dark brown sugar
3 large eggs, at room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup sour cream, at room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons espresso powder
2 tablespoons milk
2 ounces cream cheese
1 cup powdered sugar
1 pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Cooking Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease
and flour a 10-cup Bundt pan. In a heat-safe bowl or
measuring cup, combine boiling water, cocoa powder, and
espresso powder. Whisk until smooth and combined. Allow
mixture to cool slightly while you prepare the rest of the
cake. Sift together cake flour, salt, baking soda, and
baking powder. Beat butter, oil, and brown sugar in a large
bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3
minutes. Add in eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each
addition. Beat mixture for about 3 minutes on medium-high
speed after adding in last egg. Mix in 1 tablespoon vanilla.
Whisk cocoa powder-espresso mixture again to smooth it out,
then add to butter-sugar mixture. Beat on low speed until
thoroughly combined. Add in half the flour mixture and mix
until just combined. Add in sour cream and mix until just
combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until just
combined. Pour batter evenly into the prepared pan. Tap pan
sharply on the counter a few times to pop any larger air
bubbles. Bake in the preheated oven until top of the cake
springs back lightly when touched, 45 to 50 minutes. Allow
cake to cool in pan for 30 minutes before inverting onto a
serving platter to cool completely. For icing, whisk
espresso powder and milk together in a small bowl until
espresso powder is dissolved. Beat in cream cheese, powdered
sugar, salt, and vanilla with an electric mixer on low speed
to combine, then turn mixer speed up to high; continue to
beat until mixture is smooth and no clumps of cream cheese
remain. If mixture is too thick, add milk, a little at a
time, until icing is the desired consistency. If mixture is
too thin, add more powdered sugar as needed. Drizzle icing
over cooled cake.

Hamburger Bun Bread Pudding


Ingredients
3 tablespoons butter
8 brioche-style hamburger buns
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
5 large eggs
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons whiskey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups milk
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon ketchup
1 teaspoon mustard
1 teaspoon mayonnaise
1/3 cup golden raisins (optional)
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup whiskey
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 pinch salt

Cooking Instructions

Butter a 9x12-inch or 9x13-inch baking dish with 3
tablespoons butter and set aside. If buns are not already
stale and relatively dry, split them open and spread out on
a baking sheet. Bake at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) until
very lightly toasted, about 20 minutes. Let cool. For
custard batter, combine eggs, white sugar, whiskey, vanilla,
cinnamon, salt, milk, cream, ketchup, mustard, and
mayonnaise in a bowl; whisk to combine. Lay 6 bun bottoms
into the prepared baking dish. Break last 2 bun bottoms and
1/2 of a top bun into large pieces and use pieces to fill in
the gaps. Ladle half of custard mixture over buns. Place 6
bun tops over bottom layer and use the last 1 1/2 top buns
to fill in the center gap. Ladle remaining custard mixture
over. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or
preferably up to 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
(175 degrees C). Brush the tops of buns with some of the
custard mixture and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake in the
preheated oven until buns are browned and puffed up, about 1
hour. Remove to cool on a wire rack. For whiskey sauce, add
butter, whiskey, brown sugar, water, and a pinch of salt to
a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Turn off heat and let cool before using. Sauce will thicken
as it cools.

Lemon Coconut Cake


Ingredients
6 large egg yolks,
2/3 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons lemon zest
3/4 cup lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes
3 cups cake flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup sour cream,
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup coconut milk
6 large egg whites,
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
4 cups confectioner's sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon coconut milk
1 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes

Cooking Instructions

For lemon curd, add egg yolks, sugar, lemon zest, lemon
juice, salt, and butter to a small non-reactive saucepan
over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until
mixture begins to simmer and has thickened, 8 to 12 minutes.
Pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl,
using a spatula or wooden spoon to push the mixture through.
Cover with a piece of plastic wrap directly touching the top
of the curd, and refrigerate until chilled. For cakes,
preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly
grease 3 8-inch round cake pans, and line the bottoms with
parchment paper. Place coconut flakes into a food processor
or blender, and pulse a few times until coconut flakes are
finely chopped. Set aside. Sift cake flour, baking powder,
salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. In a separate
large bowl, beat butter, vegetable oil, and sugar together
with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 4
minutes. Add in sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and mix
until thoroughly combined. Add in 1/2 of flour mixture and
mix until just combined. Add in coconut milk and mix until
just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until
just combined. In a separate clean bowl, combine egg whites
and cream of tartar. With clean beaters, beat egg whites on
medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.
Add 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the batter, and fold
just until no streaks of whites remain. Add in remaining egg
white mixture and gently fold until no streaks of white
remain. Divide batter evenly between the 3 prepared cake
pans. Bake in the preheated oven until tops of cakes spring
back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cakes to
cool in pans for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack
to cool completely. For frosting, cut cold butter into
1/2-inch pieces. Place into a bowl. Starting on low speed,
beat butter with an electric mixer until just loosened.
Gradually increase the mixer speed, and beat butter until
smooth, about 2 minutes. Add in cold cream cheese, and beat
on medium-high speed until completely smooth and combined,
about 3 minutes. Add in confectioner’s sugar; beat until
thoroughly combined. Add in lemon zest, vanilla, and salt
and mix until combined. Add in remaining confectioner’s
sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add in 1 tablespoon cold coconut milk and beat mixture on
medium-high speed for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. If
frosting is a bit too soft to spread onto the cake layers,
place it into the fridge for about 10 minutes, or until it
is easier to use. To assemble the cake, place one cake layer
onto a cake plate or serving platter. Spread a thin layer of
cream cheese frosting over the top of the cake. Pipe a ring
of frosting around the top edge of the cake. Place about 2
tablespoons of lemon curd in the center of the frosting
ring, and smooth into an even layer. Stack another cake
layer on top of the first, and repeat the process of
frosting and filling. When the last cake layer is stacked on
top, frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer
of frosting. Use your hands to press the toasted coconut
flakes onto the sides of the cake. If desired, drizzle or
swirl the top of cake with some of the extra lemon curd.
Place cake into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes
before serving.

Rough Puff Pastry


Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
½ teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
½ cup cold water

Cooking Instructions

Place flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted
with a paddle attachment. Add butter and toss with your
fingertips until evenly coated with flour. Add water to
bowl. Mix on low speed until the dough forms a shaggy mass,
about 45 seconds. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and
refrigerate until butter is firm but not brittle, about 20
minutes. Transfer dough to a floured work surface and roll
into a ½-inch-thick rectangle that is about 10 ½ x 6 inches.
Fold one third of the longer side of the dough over the
center third of dough. Fold the final third over the center
(like you would fold a letter). Tightly wrap folded dough in
plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 30
minutes. Repeat this process of rolling, folding and
refrigerating 4 more times, turning the dough 90 degrees
each time before rolling. After completing the final fold,
wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until
firm before using, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.

Salted Caramel Banana Ritz Icebox Cake


Ingredients
1 1/2 cups whole milk
5.1 ounce vanilla instant pudding
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream

bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking up crackers as
needed to fill space. Spread 3 cups of the pudding mixture
in an even layer over crackers. Top pudding mixture with 2
cups of the sliced bananas. Drizzle evenly with about 2
tablespoons of the salted caramel mixture. Repeat layering
process once more, ending with a layer of salted caramel.
Evenly top with remaining 34 crackers, breaking them as
needed to fit. Spread remaining 3 cups pudding mixture over
crackers. Store, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 8
hours or up to overnight. Before serving, top with remaining
2 cups sliced bananas. Drizzle with salted caramel sauce and

Strawberries and Cream Cupcakes


Ingredients
2 cups strawberries
6 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 2/3 cups cake flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar
3 large egg whites
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2/3 cup sour cream
1/3 cup 2% milk
2 ounces cream cheese, chilled
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream

Cooking Instructions

Strawberries: Place strawberries and sugar in a small pot
over medium-low heat. Bring mixture to a simmer, stirring
often, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir cornstarch and water
together in a small bowl or measuring cup. Stir cornstarch
mixture into the strawberry mixture, and cook until
thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat, and stir in
lemon zest and lemon juice. Pour mixture into a heat safe
bowl, and place uncovered into the fridge to chill. (Once
mixture is chilled and no longer condensing, you can then
cover the bowl.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Line 2 cupcake pans with liners. Cupcakes: Sift
together cake flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and
nutmeg. Beat butter, oil, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add in egg whites,
vanilla, and almond extract, and beat mixture on medium-high
speed for another 3 minutes. Add in half of flour mixture
and mix until just combined. Add in sour cream and milk; mix
until just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture; mix
until just combined. Pour batter into prepared cupcake pans,
filling each liner no more than 2/3 full. Bake one pan at a
time, until tops of cupcakes spring back when lightly
touched, 22 to 26 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan
for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool
completely, about 30 minutes Chill cupcakes in the
refrigerator for about 1 hour. This will make them easier to
cut and fill. Cream cheese whipped cream: Beat chilled cream
cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt together until
smooth. Add in 1/2 cup cold heavy cream, and mix on low
until mixture is smooth. Add in remaining heavy cream; beat
on medium-high until mixture holds stiff peaks. If desired,
place mixture into a piping bag fitted with an open star tip
(such as a Wilton® 1M). Place piping bag in refrigerator
until ready to use. Remove cupcakes from refrigerator.
Remove the liners and cut tops off cupcakes. Pipe a layer of
whipped cream on bottom half of cupcakes; top with about 1
to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. Place tops of cupcakes
back on, and lightly press down to adhere. Pipe more whipped
cream on top of cupcakes and top with another 1 to 2
teaspoons strawberry mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for
30 minutes before serving.

Strawberry Oreo Cheesecake


Ingredients
2 cups fresh strawberries
6 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 1/4 cups Oreo® cookies
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
16 small strawberries
4 Oreo® cookies
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
1 pinch ground nutmeg
3 large eggs

Cooking Instructions

Strawberry sauce: Place strawberries, sugar, lemon juice,
and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook,
stirring often, until strawberries soften and release their
juices, about 10 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash
strawberries. Stir water and cornstarch together in a small
bowl. Add cornstarch mixture to strawberries, and cook,
stirring constantly, until mixture begins to thicken, 1 to 2
minutes more. Remove from heat, and carefully pour mixture
through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl; use the back of a
wooden spoon or spatula to press out as much juice as
possible. Discard pulp. Place strawberry sauce, uncovered,
into the refrigerator to cool. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom of a
9-inch springform pan. Oreo crust: Combine cookie crumbs,
brown sugar, and salt. Stir in melted butter until
thoroughly combined. Press mixture evenly into the bottom
and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Place pan on a
rimmed baking sheet. Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15
minutes. Remove from the oven, leaving oven on, and allow to
cool for 10 minutes. Cheesecake filling: Beat cream cheese
and sugar until thoroughly smooth and combined. Add in heavy
cream, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, almond extract,
and nutmeg; beat on low speed until smooth. Add in eggs, and
beat on low speed just until eggs are incorporated. Pour
half of filling into crust. Drizzle 6 tablespoons of cooled
strawberry sauce over filling. Pour remaining filling into
the pan, taking care to cover strawberry sauce. Reserve
remaining strawberry sauce, covered, in the refrigerator
until ready to serve the cheesecake. Return cheesecake to
the oven and bake until the top looks set, and edges are
beginning to turn golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Turn oven
off, prop the door slightly ajar, and leave cheesecake to
cool in the oven for 1 hour. Remove cheesecake to a wire
rack. Run a knife around the top edge of cheesecake to
loosen it slightly from the pan; allow to cool in the pan to
room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8
hours. When ready to serve, toss halved strawberries into
reserved strawberry sauce until thoroughly coated. Remove
cheesecake from springform pan; place on a serving platter.
Pour strawberries and sauce on top of the cake, and turn all
the berries cut-side-down. Garnish with halved Oreos, if
desired. Keep extra cheesecake stored in the fridge.

These Copycat Choco Tacos Taste Just Like the Real Thing


Ingredients
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup egg whites
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup water
vanilla fudge swirl ice cream
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup unsalted peanuts

Cooking Instructions

Gather all ingredients. Stand a thin hard cover book up
straight with the hard edge facing upwards. Drape a sheet of
parchment across the book (this is what you will use to
shape the shells). Line a plate with parchment paper. Heat
butter in a small saucepan over medium-low until melted, 2
to 3 minutes. Transfer the melted butter to a bowl, then
whisk in brown sugar, egg whites, vanilla to taste, and 1/2
teaspoon salt. Add flour and water. Whisk until the batter
is smooth and no clumps remain. Heat a non-stick skillet
over medium. Pour about 1 tablespoon batter into the pan;
spread into a thin layer with a spoon. Cook until browned on
the bottom and bubbles begin to form on top, 1 to 2 minutes.
Flip and cook until browned on other side, 1 to 2 minutes
more. Remove from pan and immediately drape over parchment-
lined book, pressing to help form that taco shell shape.
Transfer to a parchment-lined plate and repeat with
remaining batter. Let cool completely before filling.
Alternatively, preheat a waffle cone maker according to
manufacturer's instructions. Pour batter into the preheated
waffle maker and cook according to instructions. Remove from
pan and immediately drape across the parchment-lined book.
Let cool completely before filling. Remove ice cream from
the freezer and let soften for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile,
combine chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe
bowl; microwave in 30-second intervals, mixing well between
each, until mixture is melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in chopped peanuts. Carefully fill the taco shells with
the ice cream, pressing down gently to evenly distribute the
ice cream to the edges. Repeat with the remaining taco
shells. Place back on the parchment-lined plate. Dip the top
of each ice cream taco in the peanut-chocolate mixture to
completely coat the exposed ice cream. Return to the
parchment-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining tacos until
all are dipped. Once chocolate has hardened, carefully place
Choco Tacos in a sealable container or bag and return to
freezer.

yolks. Splash in about 1/4 of the milk and start blending
mixture with a whisk. Pour in remaining milk and whisk until
smooth. Cook and stir mixture over medium heat until hot to
the touch, occasionally dipping your finger in to test.
Whisk constantly until custard is thick enough to form
ribbons. Remove custard from heat and add banana liqueur,
vanilla, then cold butter. Whisk until butter dissolves. Set
custard aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200
degrees C). Begin to assemble the pudding: Toss banana
slices with lemon juice. Spread 1/4 of the custard over the
bottom of a baking dish. Add a single layer of vanilla
wafers. Cover with 1/2 of the bananas and spread 1/2 of the
remaining custard on top. Add another layer of vanilla
wafers, using slightly fewer this time. Top with remaining
bananas and custard. Smooth the top and tap dish against the
counter to settle the pudding. Make the meringue topping:
Add cream of tartar to the egg whites. Beat using the whisk
attachment until foamy. Gradually add sugar and beat until
stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Spread meringue over the
pudding using a soft spatula, creating ridges for contrast.
Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is nicely browned,
7 to 10 minutes. Serve warm or chilled.

sugar, melted butter, and vanilla in a large bowl until
combined. Mix in eggs one at a time, beating well after each
